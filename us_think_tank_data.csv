CNAS,Semiconductor Imports and U.S. National Security,"May 27, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/semiconductor-imports-and-u-s-national-security,"The Secretary of Commerce has initiated aSection 232investigation to determine the effects on the national security of imports of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products. In this submission, we analyze how these imports impact U.S. national security and provide four recommendations for the Department's consideration.

Semiconductor imports implicate U.S. national security in multiple ways. Integration with foreign markets can strengthen U.S. national security in the semiconductor sector: foreign imports provide access to semiconductors at competitive prices, enabling more efficient spending on defense industrial base priorities. However, reliance on imports in the semiconductor industry can create vulnerabilities for U.S. national security, particularly from the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) growing role in the global semiconductor supply chain.

Given the complex set of national security interests at stake, the United States needs a comprehensive national strategy for strengthening capabilities in the semiconductor sector to address national security risks arising from the PRC’s growing role in the global supply chain. We recommend the Department adopt a broad examination of potential remedies.

Recommendation: Negotiate a sectoral agreement on semiconductor supply chains to promote trade and economic security with like-minded partners

The administration should explore negotiating a sectoral trade and economic security agreement with partners and allies that share U.S. concerns associated with the PRC’s influence on the global semiconductor supply chain. By creating an integrated market of trusted suppliers, the United States and its partners can build a market large enough to maintain competition and investment in R&D while negating the national security risks posed by the PRC and other foreign adversaries. Such an agreement should include measures to deepen market integration among participants as well as alignment on common trade protection, export control, investment security, and related defensive measures.

Recommendation: Invest in and properly resource tools to enhance supply chain visibility

To better identify and proactively alleviate national security risks associated with semiconductor imports, the U.S. government needs deeper visibility into semiconductor supply chains. Without better supply chain visibility for both industry and government, firms will be vulnerable to unforeseen shocks and policies risk imprecision and unintended consequences. Given the complexity and dynamic nature of these networks, the government should seek to advance public-private cooperation to improve supply chain visibility.

Recommendation: Align any trade protection measures on semiconductors with the U.S. strategy for AI dominance

The administration has identified advancing U.S. AI dominance as a key national goal. Semiconductor policy should align with these objectives, given the fundamental role that computing power driven by semiconductors plays in advancing the AI frontier. Raising U.S. semiconductor costs in the near term—even in service of longer-term rebalancing—would carry significant strategic risk. It could slow the pace of domestic compute buildout at a critical moment, making the United States a less attractive location for training and deploying hyperscale AI systems and eroding associated U.S. leverage to shape global AI norms and prevent exploitation of compute-intensive AI capabilities by adversaries.

Recommendation: Minimize any negative spillovers on the U.S. defense industrial base

The U.S. defense industrial base is dependent on commercial off-the-shelf components in the semiconductor sector, including for both leading-edge and legacy chips as well as derivative downstream products. Given pre-existing stresses on the U.S. defense industrial base, any near term cost increases and supply chain shocks to semiconductors could introduce significant vulnerabilities to U.S. warfighting capabilities. In the course of the Section 232 investigation, as part of the Department’s consultation with the DoD as mandated by statute, the U.S. government should thoroughly assess both immediate and longer term impacts of trade protection measures on the U.S. defense industrial base."
CNAS,Countering AI Chip Smuggling Has Become a National Security Priority,"June 11, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/countering-ai-chip-smuggling-has-become-a-national-security-priority,"Based on the available evidence, artificial intelligence (AI) chip smuggling has likely been occurring at a scale that significantly undermines U.S. attempts to restrict the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) access to advanced AI. This is indicated by four lines of argument:

Smuggling should be expected based on historical precedent. The PRC has a long history of smuggling U.S. technology despite export restrictions, which has rarely resulted in criminal or civil penalties.1

Smuggling of U.S. AI chips is highly incentivized by their superior performance, higher supply, and more mature software ecosystem relative to chips legally available to Chinese AI labs.2Based on publicly available data, of the 22 notable models that had been developed exclusively in the PRC by 2025, only two were trained with Chinese chips.3

Six news outlets have independently reported evidence of large-scale AI chip smuggling, totaling tens to hundreds of thousands of chips smuggled in 2024. One smuggler reportedly handled an order of for servers containing 2,400 NVIDIA H100s—worth $120 million—to a customer in the PRC.4Another facilitated an order worth $103 million.5Singapore authorities arrested three individuals suspected of diverting AI servers worth $390 million.6Within this reporting, multiple chip resellers and start-ups in the PRC have claimed that gaining access to export-controlled AI chips is straightforward, with one Chinese start-up founder estimating in 2024 that there were more than 100,000 NVIDIA H100s in the PRC.7Most of the Chinese chip sellers interviewed in these reports confirm that they work with multiple distributors, use shell companies based overseas, and employ simple tactics to avoid detection, such as relabeling shipments as tea or toys.8

There are many online listings for export-controlled AI chips available for purchase in the PRC.The authors conducted a non-exhaustive search of three Chinese online marketplaces and found 132 domestic listings for export-controlled chips, along with many photos of supposedly smuggled goods.9Where sellers provided information on stock, the average quantity of export-controlled graphics processing units (GPUs) per listing was around 1,200 for GPU server listings and 400 for GPU card listings. Though this data is patchy and likely unreliable, the total stock implied is around 100,000 H100 GPUs, as of December 2024.

Across these data sources, there is much uncertainty in either direction. Using publicly available data from this reporting, while accounting for uncertainty about its veracity, the authors estimate the total scale of AI chip smuggling to the PRC in 2024 could have ranged anywhere from 10,000 to several hundred thousand chips, with a median estimate of around 140,000. This estimate is based on a probabilistic model of chip smuggling as an extrapolation of known cases. It should be understood as a high-level distribution of possible outcomes, rather than a summation of confirmed smuggling cases.10

If the true number is close to the median of this distribution,smuggled chips would make up a significant portion of AI compute acquired by the PRC in 2024—between 1 and 30 percent of its inference compute capacity (median 6 percent) or between 1 and 40 percent of its training compute capacity (median 10 percent).Other sources of PRC AI compute acquisition considered are Huawei Ascend chips fabricated by China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and NVIDIA H20 chips legally exported into the PRC. Because the export of the H20 was restricted in April 2025, and TSMC is under investigation for its role in fabricating chips for Huawei, smuggled chips may make up a much larger portion of AI compute acquired by the PRC in 2025 and beyond.11

Given the potential scale of AI chip smuggling to the PRC, policymakers should prioritize gathering information to better understand its true extent. Large-scale chip smuggling and uncertainty about its true extent exist partly because the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)—the part of government tasked with administering and enforcing AI chip export controls—is under-resourced. The BIS’s budget for enforcement has decreased in real terms over time, even after it was tasked with far more responsibilities in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the introduction of a wide range of new export controls on AI chips and related tooling. The profits likely netted by chip smugglers from just three reported smuggling cases fromThe New York TimesandThe Informationare more than double the BIS’s annual budget for export control enforcement.12

AI chip smuggling is a recent problem, and counterefforts remain limited. Moreover, AI chip companies typically lack the deep experience in exporting sensitive goods that exists, for example, in the defense industry. As a result, there are many promising steps that government and industry could take to solve this problem. The authors offer six recommendations:

AI chip companies and their distributors should leverage their technical capacities and resources to significantly strengthen theirdue diligence processes,make similar requirements of any distribution firms to which they sell, and report to the BIS on specific measures taken.

The BIS could use its existing authorities tocreate a new notification requirement for controlled AI chip exports, reexports, and ownership transfers.This would enable much better tracking of controlled chips exported outside the United States, allowing for more efficient enforcement.

AI chip designers should implement software-basedlocation verificationfeatures, allowing the owner of a controlled chip to prove that the chip is not located in the PRC. This would both provide valuable data on the scale of chip smuggling and provide a useful mechanism for enforcement, enabling knowledge of which specific devices have been smuggled, and knowledge of which exporters and downstream entities were responsible. BIS could incentivize the development of these features through the normal export licensing process today, by requiring chip owners outside the United States to periodically prove that their chips are not in the PRC as a condition for importing chips.

The Department of Commerce, incoordination with the intelligence community (IC), could establish processes to generate information on the scale, locations, and perpetrators of AI chip smuggling, and share it with the BIS to aid enforcement, inform policy, and share leads with relevant industry actors. This could be facilitated through the Director for National intelligence (DNI) updating the National Intelligence Priorities Framework to make intelligence collection related to export control enforcement a top priority, and the DNI and Secretary of Commerce establishing a joint analysis team (for example, in the Export Control Enforcement Center) to facilitate BIS-IC coordination.

Congress could authorize awhistleblower incentive programand qui tam lawsuits(lawsuits that allow a private person to prosecute on behalf of the government) to incentivize reports of possible export violations. These two measures could significantly boost the BIS’s export enforcement while paying for themselves in revenue generated through additional penalties. A whistleblower program could be modeled on the highly successful Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Whistleblower Program, which tackles federal securities laws violations and has aided the collection of $7 billion to $22 billion in penalties since 2011.13In April 2025, a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate to implement such a program.14Authorizing qui tam lawsuits against those who violate the export rules would additionally allow individuals to sue a violator and collect a portion of the resulting penalty, modeled on a similar law in the False Claims Act.

Finally, Congress could grantthe White House’s requested budget of $313 million for the BISfor fiscal year 2026. This 64 percent increase over the BIS’s current budget of $191 million would help the BIS modernize its tooling and improve operational capacity. In addition to strengthening national security, funding to improve the enforcement of the AI chip controls would likely pay for itself through increased collection of fines on violators of the export rules. The multiple documented instances of AI chip smuggling from 2024 alone could each have resulted in penalties of over $200 million, more than the BIS’s annual budget.

As controlling access to advanced AI capabilities becomes an increasing national security imperative, U.S. policymakers should prioritize actions to collect more reliable information on the extent of AI chip smuggling and close gaps wherever possible."

CNAS,Sanctions by the Numbers: 2024 Year in Review,"March 11, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/sanctions-by-the-numbers-2024-year-in-review,"Executive Summary
In 2024, the United States issued an unprecedented number of financial sanctions and entity-based export controls. Washington’s economic statecraft has expanded in recent years, largely in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, competition with the People’s Republic of China, and tensions in the Middle East. These geopolitical developments, along with escalating concerns about deepening ties among U.S. adversaries, shaped how the United States deployed its coercive economic toolkit last year. This installment of Sanctions by the Numbers examines the United States’ use of financial sanctions—through the Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List—and entity-based export controls—via the Commerce Department’s Entity List—in 2024.
The Treasury Department added 3,135 persons (i.e., individuals or entities) to the SDN List in 2024. This is a 25 percent increase from 2023, when 2,502 persons were designated.
The Commerce Department placed 520 persons on the Entity List in 2024, an 11 percent increase from 2023, when 468 persons were added.
Russia was the primary target of U.S. financial sanctions, with 1,706 Russian persons placed on the SDN List. Russia was also the second-largest recipient of entity-based export controls, with 147 Russian persons added to the Entity List.
China received the second-highest number of financial sanctions and the most entity-based export controls, with 276 Chinese persons placed on the SDN List and 263 Chinese persons added to the Entity List.
The analysis is based on the authors’ review of U.S. government data on SDN designations and Entity List additions, including press releases and Federal Register Notices that accompany such designations and additions. The data used in this report can be found

. This report covers SDN designations and Entity List additions for calendar year 2024. Where appropriate, certain news developments past this period are noted in the analysis, but no sanctions after December 31, 2024, are reflected in the numbers."
CNAS,How the U.S. Can Counter China's Digital Silk Road in Saudi Arabia,"September 16, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/press/press-release/how-the-u-s-can-counter-chinas-digital-silk-road-in-saudi-arabia,"Washington, September 16, 2025 – Today, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) released a new report,
Countering the Digital Silk Road: Saudi Arabia
by
Vivek Chilukuri
and
Ruby Scanlon
.
The Digital Silk Road (DSR) is China’s initiative to shape critical digital infrastructure around the world. As the DSR marks its 10th anniversary, the CNAS Technology and National Security Program has undertaken a major research project to assess its impact and explore how the United States and its allies can offer a more compelling and coherent alternative. The project includes four case studies of strategically critical nations—
Indonesia
,
Brazil
,
Kenya
, and Saudi Arabia—and will culminate in an in-depth final report in October.
The series’ fourth and final case study covers the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Through Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia seeks to transition from its longtime petro-economy into a global tech powerhouse. Up to 70 percent of Vision 2030’s goals relate to data and artificial intelligence (AI), but the kingdom will need foreign partners to realize them. Recognizing the opportunity, both the United States and China now compete fiercely to become the kingdom’s preferred partner as it undergoes this historic, technology-driven transformation.
The new case study traces the history of U.S.-Saudi and Sino-Saudi technology partnerships and details the rapidly expanding U.S.-China competition within the kingdom with a focus on data centers, semiconductors, and AI. The report also provides an in-depth look at new Saudi state-backed investment arms, initiatives, and policies driving the country’s technology transformation.
The report concludes that, although Riyadh will resist demands for outright alignment with the U.S. technology ecosystem given its maturing relationship with Beijing, considerable opportunity remains for U.S. officials and industry to outcompete China’s DSR in the heart of Arabia while protecting sensitive U.S. technologies. The report recommends that policymakers:
Conclude a secure, phased, and verifiable deal with Saudi Arabia for advanced AI chips.
Support the expansion of Saudi fabrication capacity for legacy chips while limiting support for leading-edge semiconductor design tools and research.
Establish a process to fast-track inbound investments from allied and partner sources for U.S. strategic technologies.
Leverage people-to-people ties to support Riyadh’s Saudization policies.
Engage the Saudi Communications, Space, and Technology Commission about the draft Global AI Hub Law.
Pilot a joint effort by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the Department of Energy to bolster AI data center security in strategic overseas markets, like Saudi Arabia.
Support eventual Saudi transition to 6G through research partnerships.

CNAS,"America Should Rent, Not Sell, AI Chips to China","August 15, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/america-should-rent-not-sell-ai-chips-to-china,"This article was originally published onRAND.President Trump announced Monday that Nvidia will pay the U.S. government 15 percent of the revenue it derives from sales of its H20 chip to China—an unusual arrangement that gives up leverage. The United States could do better: Rather than selling AI chips, the United States should instead rent them to China to permanently maintain its AI chip edge.Controversy surrounding NVIDIA's China-specific H20 AI chip has reignited debate over chip exports to China. Proponents of H20 exports argue that sales keep China dependent on U.S. technology while generating revenue. They claim denying access would only accelerate China's drive for homegrown alternatives. These arguments miss a superior alternative to selling chips that would yield similar benefits to the United States: providing China with the computing power it seeks for a fee via remote cloud access

Selling AI chips to China outright reduces America's AI lead for little benefit.

Selling AI chips to China outright reduces America's AI lead for little benefit.

When the United States sells chips, they're gone forever—disappearing into data centers with unknown users pursuing unknown goals. There's another option: give users the computing power of chips remotely. Cloud services offer almost everything chip sales promise, plus actual control: access can be shut off at any stage (PDF) as geopolitical conditions change or threats arise. The economics are better too. AI chips are sold to U.S. cloud providers, who generate additional revenue by renting AI chips to China—creating two revenue streams instead of one. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft already serve global customers this way, maintaining physical possession of the chips while providing computational power on demand.Unlike physical chip exports, cloud access makes it significantly harder for customers to redirect access to unauthorized parties. Know-your-customer requirements enable monitoring for connections to Chinese military entities. Cloud access also creates continuous leverage—every renewal becomes a negotiation opportunity, compared to chips that get replaced only every three to four years.Read the full article onRAND."
CNAS,Rethinking the Global AI Race,"July 21, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/rethinking-the-global-ai-race,"This article was originally published onJust Security.The global competition over artificial intelligence is increasingly framed in stark and dramatic terms, often compared to the Manhattan Project, a new arms race, or a moonshot project requiring incredible resources to attain a difficult, if not, impossible goal. These analogies all suffer from a common flaw: they point us toward the wrong goal. AI is not a discrete project with a clear endpoint, like building a nuclear weapon or landing on the moon. It is a long-term, society-wide effort to develop powerful tools and ensure their benefits reach classrooms, battlefields, factories, and start-ups alike.

The country that leverages advances in AI to establish and maintain substantial economic and military advantages will not necessarily be the one that develops the most advanced models in the shortest amount of time. The United States is not going to win the AI race against China, for example, simply because U.S.-made OpenAI models beat Chinese-made DeepSeek or Kimi K2 models on capability benchmarks. Instead, countries that learn how to bridge the gap between invention and widespread societal adoption will reap the most crucial benefits in the long term.

The United States must stop running as if this were only a 100-meter dash and start acting like a strategic marathoner: moving with urgency, clarity, and sustained commitment.

By taking a longer view, the United States can make smarter decisions about how to align technological progress with national security and public welfare. If it continues to frame AI primarily as a short-term sprint toward technical milestones, it risks falling behind global peers and adversaries.Gaining and maintaining a long-term competitive advantage in AI will require more than technical superiority. It demands reorienting education and workforce training, modernizing institutions, and setting a national vision based on broad public engagement.

CNAS,Countering the Digital Silk Road,"October 15, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/countering-the-digital-silk-road,"Executive Summary

The year 2025 marks the 10th anniversary of the Digital Silk Road (DSR), China’s effort to strengthen its global ties and influence through technology. In the decade since the initiative’s launch, technology has moved to the center of emerging market priorities, China’s domestic and foreign policy, and the U.S.-China competition. Rapid digitalization, spurred by emerging market policies seeking to harness technology’s potential, has led to surging global demand for the connective infrastructure and cutting-edge services that will power the modern world. But even as technology vaults to the top of government and corporate agendas, the DSR’s origins, goals, and tools remain obscured, complicating U.S. and allied efforts to assess its effectiveness and mobilize a response.

Those seeking official strategies and plans behind the DSR will be disappointed. Its nature is amorphous, expanding alongside Beijing’s growing interest in strategic technologies and receding as commercial and political interests require. Ten years after its inception, the Digital Silk Road is, paradoxically, at once less visible and more ubiquitous than ever. Launched in 2015 as the digital arm of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the DSR grew into its own effort as technology leadership became increasingly important to Beijing. Rising backlash against the BRI and the DSR abroad, however, made formal affiliation with a state-led initiative a liability, and Chinese officials and companies now rarely tout official linkages. Domestic economic headwinds and fiscal pressures also caused Beijing to retrench from the earlier years of massive state-backed infrastructure projects in favor of a “small yet smart” approach that emphasized technology as a low-cost, high-impact avenue of continued developmental support. At home, Beijing embraced technology as a path to economic diversification, development, and security consistent with the Made in China 2025 initiative. Private and semiprivate companies—Huawei, ZTE, Alibaba, and Tencent—led the way, with considerable success. Huawei is now the world’s top provider of telecommunications equipment and operates in over 170 countries.

Beijing’s public retreat from the DSR should not be mistaken for failure. On the contrary, the DSR’s ambition—to strengthen China’s economic and geopolitical leadership through technology—has now suffused Beijing’s broader domestic and foreign policy. The DSR has largely disappeared because it has succeeded and become subsumed. The DSR may not be state directed, like the BRI, but it is undoubtedly stateenabled. At every stage, government support drives the innovation, deployment, and scale needed within China to underprice and outcompete in the wider world—in 5G telecommunications equipment, facial recognition cameras, legacy semiconductors, and, more recently, commercial drones and electric vehicles.

Over the past decade, U.S. and allied policymakers have slowly awoken to the varied, overlapping dangers of the DSR. Concern has focused on how the diffusion of Chinese-linked digital infrastructure could create cybersecurity and espionage risks and avenues of coercive influence for Beijing over emerging markets, akin to the dynamics of the BRI. Others have focused on the spread of techno-authoritarianism. All these concerns are valid and troubling. At the same time, it is neither realistic nor desirable to arrest, let alone reverse, the diffusion of all Chinese-linked digital infrastructure and services everywhere. China remains the top trading partner for most of the world, and technology represents an increasing share of that trade. Not all Chinese-linked technology diffusion is inherently nefarious; indeed, much of it involves innocuous consumer goods that pose little or no risk. Hysteria about Chinese technology diffusion is not a strategy. U.S. and allied policymakers must therefore prioritize the key countries and technology domains that both implicate core economic and security interests and represent credible opportunities to outcompete Chinese offerings.

The DSR’s ambition—to strengthen China’s economic and geopolitical leadership through technology—has now suffused Beijing’s broader domestic and foreign policy.

The DSR’s ambition—to strengthen China’s economic and geopolitical leadership through technology—has now suffused Beijing’s broader domestic and foreign policy.

With this in mind, the report suggests six priority technology domains: subsea cables, next-generation telecommunications, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, data centers and cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI), and smart cities. Together, these domains form the foundation of the digital infrastructure and services that will power the economies and governments of the modern world. The United States and its allies must not allow China to dominate these domains in key emerging market security partners, such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, and Egypt, recognizing that any strategy that seeks to stop Chinese technology everywhere—even in these countries—is doomed to fail.

The case for countering the DSR is as much about seizing opportunity as mitigating risks. Unlike the global transition to 4G and 5G networks, when the West lacked competitors that could match Huawei and ZTE’s state-subsidized offerings, the United States and its allies have a formidable hand to play in several vital technology transitions now unfolding across the globe. U.S. firms dominate the AI frontier, dwarfing competitors in capital investments and model capabilities. U.S. firms command 70 percent of the global cloud market. Over 90 percent of the global subsea cable infrastructure was built by U.S. or allied companies. Since 2020, Starlink has launched more LEO satellites than all its competitors combined. Washington and its allies now have a generational opportunity to wield these strengths to positively shape digital ecosystems around the world, secure first-mover advantages, and box out Chinese companies’ ability to reinvest overseas revenue to close gaps in strategic technologies.

But doing so will require a bold new approach. Over the past decade, the United States and its allies have haltingly rolled out new offices, initiatives, and funding mechanisms to match the DSR. The G7 touts a new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) to deploy $600 billion; the United States has mobilized just one-tenth of that amount to date. The Quad’s ambition to support subsea cables, cybersecurity, and other digital infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific is well directed but similarly under-resourced. The European Union’s Global Gateway committed $350 billion for global infrastructure, but meaningful coordination with U.S. investments and the PGI remains sparse.

The U.S. government has mounted several reforms to level up America’s technology statecraft. The State Department established the new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy. Congress created new investment tools through the International Development Finance Corporation, International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, and Countering PRC Influence Fund. Administrations of both parties have pursued efforts to promote a standards-based model for secure and trusted technology promotion abroad, such as the Clean Network initiative from President Donald Trump’s first administration and the now-rescinded Framework for AI Diffusion from President Joe Biden’s administration. At the same time, U.S. allies like the EU, Japan, and Australia have embraced a more security-minded approach to foreign assistance and strengthened coordination. These efforts are welcome, overdue, and wholly insufficient.

In the short term, as the Trump administration considers a new iteration of the AI Diffusion Rule, it should raise its sights and offer the world not only a framework for accessing cutting-edge AI chips, but advanced technologies more broadly to draw them into the U.S. technology ecosystem. The administration should also recognize that it cannot ask emerging markets to limit Beijing’s leverage through the DSR as the United States exploits its own economic leverage through rapidly shifting tariff and export control policies. Long-term technology partnerships require a foundation of trust that recent policies risk undermining.

Washington and its allies now have a generational opportunity to wield their strengths to positively shape digital ecosystems around the world. But doing so will require a bold new approach.

Washington and its allies now have a generational opportunity to wield their strengths to positively shape digital ecosystems around the world. But doing so will require a bold new approach.

In the longer term, the United States must recognize that the lesson of the 5G race is that market forces alone cannot guarantee U.S. and allied tech adoption—especially as China doubles down on support for strategic technologies. The answer, however, is not to mirror Beijing’s government-driven approach, but to pursue more ambitious statecraft fit for an era of global technology competition.

To that end, the report offers the following recommendations:

Strategy and Coordination

Craft a Global Technology Competition Strategy.The White House should direct the State Department, led by the undersecretary for economic growth, energy, and the environment and the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, to develop a detailed strategy that (1) prioritizes countries for U.S. engagement, (2) identifies the most strategically vital technology domains, and (3) aligns U.S. investments and other tools accordingly.

Establish a Strategic Competition Council.The White House should create an interagency Strategic Competition Council to elevate and better coordinate U.S. efforts to counter Chinese influence in strategic markets and sectors abroad, including digital infrastructure and emerging technologies.

Strategic Investment

Establish a new U.S. Partnership Agencyby consolidating the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), PGI, and the International Trade Administration’s Global Markets and Industry & Analysis functions. At the same time, consolidation must not be a pretext for cutting the overall resources that these agencies receive, beyond any efficiencies from streamlining. This moment demands more investment in proactive commercial engagement, not less.

Alternatively, the White House and Congress should reform the DFC and EXIM for the global technology competition.

DFC—Congress should quadruple its total lending authority to $240 billion and designate emerging technologies and digital infrastructure as a priority area. Congress should also loosen restrictions that often block the DFC from supporting digital infrastructure projects that may incidentally benefit high-income countries and modernize how the DFC accounts for equity investments, consistent with the Enhancing American Competitiveness Act.

EXIM—Policymakers should require the EXIM to allocate at least half its lending support to projects that counter China and promote advanced technologies, relax U.S. shipping and content requirements for China and Transformational Exports Program investments, and at least double the EXIM’s default cap to 4 percent.

Review and potentially expand the International Technology Security and Innovation Fund (ITSI),administered by the State Department, which promotes secure telecommunications networks and resilient information and communications technology (ICT) and semiconductor supply chains abroad. ITSI currently has $500 million in funding over five years.

Expand and reform the Countering PRC Influence Fund (CPIF).Congress should revise the CPIF’s authorizing language to make countering the DSR an explicit priority and scale it to at least $1 billion, increasing it further based on performance.

Expand the USTDA’s Global Procurement Initiative.The Global Procurement Initiative improves the capacity of foreign public officials to account for the full life cycle of costs, such as security, reliability, and maintenance, when making significant procurement decisions.

Leverage U.S. influence over multilateral development banks to raise standards for all ICT projects.Washington and its allies should leverage their financial contributions to multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, to raise procurement standards to further emphasize quality, trust, and security, drawing on insights from the USTDA’s Global Procurement Initiative.

Identify and prepare for critical procurement decisions for digital infrastructure and services in priority emerging markets.The State Department should direct embassies to identify the life cycle of digital infrastructure, determine future procurement junctures when such infrastructure will require modernization or replacement, and work now to prepare U.S. and allied alternatives.

Technology Diplomacy

Pilot a cohort of Foreign Technology Officers.A pilot class of Foreign Technology Officers would receive extensive training in critical and emerging technology policy and deploy to priority posts abroad.

Expand training for Cyberspace and Digital Policy Statecraft at the Foreign Service Institute.Established in 2024, the class is routinely oversubscribed. The State Department should increase offerings and require this training for Regional China Officers.

Appoint more ambassadors with leadership experience in the technology sector.Few U.S. diplomats, and especially ambassadors and senior Foreign Service Officers, have a deep background in technology, limiting their ability to elevate and shape technology policy on the ground.

Expand the number of U.S. Commercial Service Officers and DFC employees deployed abroadto increase support for U.S. technology companies to identify and secure strategic opportunities in emerging markets.

Focus the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Strategic Capital.The White House should ensure that the office focuses on providing analysis about which emerging markets deserve prioritization from the Defense Department’s perspective; otherwise, it should focus investments on U.S. and allied defense-relevant technologies overlooked by current market incentives.

Leverage NATO member-state investment funds.NATO should convene a summit to explore opportunities for member-state sovereign wealth funds and other investment funds to support digital ecosystems in priority emerging markets. Canada, Denmark, Italy, Norway, and Türkiye—and perhaps, soon, the United States—have sovereign wealth funds. Norway’s fund is the largest in the world, with $1.8 trillion in assets.

Technology Partnerships

Create a mechanism for countries to request strategic technology partnerships with the United States.Washington should create a framework for foreign governments to request strategic technology partnerships with the United States. Washington could lay out clear, broadly consistent criteria—as it did with the now-rescinded Framework for AI Diffusion—as a condition for these partnerships, such as robust intellectual property and cybersecurity protections and divestment from China-linked digital infrastructure. In exchange, Washington would fast-track approvals and support from bodies like the new U.S. Partnership Agency and expand technology trade missions, research collaboration, and talent exchanges.

Strengthen and focus the American AI Exports Program on key emerging markets.The July 2025 executive order on Promoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stack requires industry proposals for a full-stack AI technology export package. Given limited capacity and resources, the administration should focus the newly created program on priority emerging markets. The Economic Diplomacy Action Group empowered under the July 2025 executive order should undertake a comprehensive review of all relevant federal tools and resources to identify opportunities to streamline application procedures, requirements, and review timelines.

Elevate smart cities in the AI Exports Program.In developing the new AI Exports Program, the Trump administration should clarify that it will prioritize AI-enabled smart city applications that respect democratic values to jump-start the development of integrated rights-respecting U.S. offerings able to compete with China’s techno-authoritarian alternatives.

Focus coordination with allies and partners in strategic regions to maximize impact.The United States should work more closely with technology-leading allies and partners to identify select “swing states” and strategic technology areas and align investments and engagement to the maximum extent possible—for instance, by leveraging the EU’s Global Gateway and the Trilateral Infrastructure Partnership between Australia, Japan, and the United States.

Create a U.S. Partnership Portal for both U.S. and foreign companies, universities, and research institutions to harness existing U.S. government tools and resources.The White House should create a single point of entry where U.S. companies and foreign counterparts can access all the relevant resources and personnel.

CNAS,Accelerate America’s Quantum Technology Leadership,"January 20, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/accelerate-americas-quantum-technology-leadership,"As the U.S.-China competition for quantum technology leadership continues to intensify, the Trump administration should prioritize both advancing and protecting the country’s quantum lead.

By supporting the transition of quantum sensors, the administration can equip the armed services with highly precise and resilient navigation and timing capabilities within a few years.

Reauthorizing the first Trump administration’s 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act would advance the country’s cutting-edge research and grow the talent base.

To prevent misappropriation of U.S. investments and ingenuity, the administration should also address gaps in quantum technology export controls and research security.

Securing America’s quantum leadership is a national security imperative. This emerging technology field is expected to bring unprecedented industrial capabilities from agriculture to drug discovery, but also to break the encryption protocols safeguarding U.S. digital infrastructure and to provide new advantages in the battlefield.1The quantum technology competition with China is intensifying, and U.S. dominance is not guaranteed. Indeed, China leads in quantum communications and is inching close behind the United States on quantum computing and sensing.2

The Trump administration should seize the opportunity to consolidate the legacy of its landmark National Quantum Initiative, which has yielded years of leading research and bolstered the budding U.S. quantum industry.3These recommendations provide an initial pathway for the administration to advance and protect America’s hard-earned quantum lead.

Accelerate the transition of quantum sensors to address America’s Global Positioning System (GPS) vulnerabilities.GPS’s vulnerability to disruptions, including adversaries’ rising jamming and spoofing attacks, poses a serious threat to U.S. military operations and critical infrastructure, as President Trump’s 2020 Executive Order 13905 highlighted.4Quantum clocks and sensors can address this national security challenge by offering highly precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities without relying on frequent GPS synchronization. These technologies recently have been demonstrated in aircraft, at sea, and in space, but their deployment requires greater integration, ruggedization, and reductions in size and cost.5

The Trump administration is positioned to field quantum sensors for the armed services within a few years. To ensure this, the administration should:

Urge Congress to prioritize funding the Department of Defense's (DoD) Quantum Transition Acceleration program.This collaboration between the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the Defense Innovation Unit can rapidly advance mission-critical quantum sensing solutions for the armed services for approximately $70 million annually—a figure that is dwarfed by current investments in quantum computing (a field that remains much more nascent) and the up to hundreds of millions of dollars in estimated daily costs from losing GPS service.6A firm demand signal for quantum sensors from the government would attract private investment and further accelerate their deployment.

Establish an interagency program to advance the transition of quantum sensors across national security applications.Bringing the DoD together with additional end users of quantum sensors for PNT such as NASA and the Departments of Homeland Security, Energy, and Transportation could maximize government investments by facilitating knowledge sharing and creating a larger, more enticing market for the private sector. A memorandum of understanding among the agencies could be a start, but a formal program with defined activities and timelines would be more effective.7

This emerging technology field is expected to bring unprecedented industrial capabilities from agriculture to drug discovery, but also to break the encryption protocols safeguarding U.S. digital infrastructure and to provide new advantages in the battlefield.

Reauthorize the 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act (NQIA) to boost America’s research and talent base.While China and many others have launched quantum strategies and substantive investments, the first Trump administration’s NQIA ran out of authorized funding in 2023.8Reauthorizing this bill would demonstrate America’s unequivocal commitment to quantum leadership and enable the new administration to focus federal funding on critical areas with low private investment. Specifically, the new NQIA should:

Support fundamental science and engineering research programs.Quantum technologies like computing and networking have made important progress in recent years, but they remain at early R&D stages. Government spending should prioritize fundamental research in underdeveloped fields—such as quantum algorithms, error correction, and quantum engineering—that may lead to the breakthroughs needed to scale quantum systems and bring these technologies to fruition.9To maximize impact and long-term sustainability, these federal investments should be leveraged to attract additional support from academia, industry, and state and local governments.

Expand America’s quantum workforce.The quantum industry is voicing shortages in qualified U.S. talent.10In fact, 50–70 percent of those receiving quantum-relevant PhDs in the United States are foreign students, mostly from China.11The United States must grow its quantum talent at all levels, especially as over half the quantum jobs are estimated to not require advanced degrees.12The NQIA should prioritize solving these critical gaps and expanding employment opportunities by authorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a quantum workforce development hub. Its activities might include ongoing assessments of the knowledge and skills required by different quantum subfields (e.g., sensing, computing hardware, algorithms, communications, and enabling technologies), gathering and disseminating training programs, and running outreach campaigns. To ensure these programs meet employer and local needs, the NSF should coordinate with industry, including through the Quantum Economic Development Consortium, as well as with regional efforts, such as the Colorado Quantum Tech Hub.13Coordination with workforce programs in semiconductors and related fields could further optimize investments and avoid duplication.14

Strengthen America’s quantum technology protection strategy.In addition to building domestic capabilities, securing U.S. quantum technology leadership requires protecting this progress against espionage, intellectual property theft, and broader technology transfer to China and beyond. To effectively safeguard America’s quantum edge, the administration should:

Address the gaps in the Biden administration’s export controls on quantum computing.The controls require substantial improvements to block China’s technology access without hurting the U.S. industry.15The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) should clarify the language of its controlled technology categories to resolve ambiguities and avoid under- and over-compliance, as well as consider revising these controls periodically as the field of quantum computing continues to evolve rapidly.16Additionally, the administration should continue pressing allies and partners to quickly adopt similar controls to avoid China’s access through other markets and to prevent U.S. suppliers from bearing the brunt of the impacts of restricted trade. The BIS also can strengthen its deemed export requirements to better prevent technology leaks via foreigners inside the country. All nationals from countries of concern with access to the controlled quantum technologies should be reported to the government, not just new hires, and the BIS should impose risk mitigation strategies or deny access altogether whenever the reported access jeopardizes U.S. national security.

The Trump administration should seize the opportunity to consolidate the legacy of its landmark National Quantum Initiative, which has yielded years of leading research and bolstered the budding U.S. quantum industry.

The Trump administration should seize the opportunity to consolidate the legacy of its landmark National Quantum Initiative, which has yielded years of leading research and bolstered the budding U.S. quantum industry.

Incentivize stronger internal security protocols in the quantum industry.Government agencies should leverage financial incentives, such as contracts and high-funding research programs like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Quantum Benchmarking Initiative, to demand quantum organizations of all sizes to strengthen their cyber, physical, and personnel security protections.17Moreover, law enforcement and intelligence agencies should continue engaging with the quantum ecosystem to inform them of security threats and proactively mitigate all potential vectors of technology leakage.18

Accelerate the implementation of the first Trump administration’s research security memorandum.National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) was published in early 2021 to enhance the protection of federally funded research against foreign government interference and exploitation, but many measures have not yet taken effect.19The new Trump administration should press funding agencies to implement NSPM-33, and additional research security requirements in the CHIPS and Science Act, promptly and effectively.20A relevant program to watch is the NSF’s new grant review process, which will pilot this year with a focus on quantum.21To maximize fairness and “getting to yes,” each quantum proposal will undergo a multistage review to determine if the project scope and investigators trigger national security concerns, and to subsequently negotiate a risk mitigation plan with the research institution.22This case-by-case model risks being too idiosyncratic and time-consuming, which could hinder both the progress and security of U.S. innovation. The program’s effectiveness should be compared to more straightforward approaches like the DoD’s risk matrix, or the Canadian government’s, which simply does not fund quantum projects whose investigators have connections to a list of proscribed entities.23

Continue the country’s migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).Future quantum computers may be able to break public-key cryptography and expose highly sensitive U.S. information, from military and intelligence communications to critical infrastructure and the broader civilian sector. To protect against this threat, the administration should continue to lead the swift migration of U.S. digital systems to PQC standards as outlined in National Security Memorandum 10, prioritizing public and private entities critical to national security.24The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and National Security Agency should provide ongoing guidance as well as authoritative vetting of PQC security vendors.25The administration also should press countries around the world to quickly adopt the NIST’s PQC standards, rather than developing their own, to avoid global interoperability issues.26

Together, these recommendations highlight the many opportunities for the administration to consolidate its quantum legacy and both promote and protect the United States’ global quantum supremacy.

CNAS,Beyond DeepSeek: How China’s AI Ecosystem Fuels Breakthroughs,"February 14, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/beyond-deepseek-how-chinas-ai-ecosystem-fuels-breakthroughs,"In mid-January, leading U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) companies were sent reeling. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, unveiled its R1 model, a new chatbot of comparable quality to OpenAI’s GPT-4. While many analysts rushed to scrutinize DeepSeek’s technical capabilities, a more fundamental question loomed: How did a Chinese lab achieve such an impressive feat?

The answer lies not just in DeepSeek’s top engineers or innovative training techniques, but in the vast political and financial ecosystem China has built to accelerate AI innovation. Over the past decade, the Chinese government has made AI development a national priority, directing considerable sums of money, policy incentives, and public-private partnership opportunities toward ensuring that Beijing can compete—and ultimately lead—in AI.

While the United States should not mimic China’s state-backed funding model, it also can’t leave AI’s future to the market alone.

While the United States should not mimic China’s state-backed funding model, it also can’t leave AI’s future to the market alone.

A recent investigation by Radio Free Asia has revealed that DeepSeek is closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party, benefiting from the state’s full-throttle push for AI leadership. However, DeepSeek’s parent company, High-Flyer, began not as an AI laboratory but as a quantitative hedge fund using AI for stock trading. Beijing’s 2021 crackdown on speculative investments forced High-Flyer to pivot. Seeking to align with government priorities, High-Flyer transitioned to AI research—giving rise to DeepSeek.

By December 2023, DeepSeek had been designated a “national high-tech enterprise,” or HTNE, by Zhejiang provincial authorities. The coveted status, awarded by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, grants preferential tax treatment, government subsidies, and research grants. These tools demonstrate Beijing’s commitment to fostering homegrown AI. The company’s political significance was cemented in early 2024 when DeepSeek’s co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, was invited to offer “opinions and suggestions” to Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing. This official recognition of DeepSeek’s expertise made clear that China sees DeepSeek as not just another AI lab but as a champion of its technological ambitions.

CNAS,Five Objectives to Guide U.S. AI Diffusion,"April 29, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/five-objectives-to-guide-u-s-ai-diffusion,"Summary

The Framework for AI Diffusion (the Framework) is an ambitious proposal to shape the global distribution of critical AI capabilities, maintain U.S. AI leadership, and prevent sensitive technologies from reaching the PRC and other adversaries. We endorse the Framework’s core national security objectives to protect advanced AI capabilities and prevent proliferation that goes against U.S. interests.

The coming years will be critical for determining which country will lead the global AI transformation. The AI Diffusion Rule, despite its risks, could help preserve U.S. leadership at this critical juncture and manage unwanted technology transfer to adversaries. Even short pauses in controls could open the floodgates for chip stockpiling and smuggling. Recognizing that any policy is only as good as its implementation, we urge policymakers to align the design of any revisions to the Framework with the capacity to implement and enforce them.

The Framework’s complexity and broad use of export controls has generated substantial concern among international partners.We therefore recommend that the Trump administration balance restrictive measures designed to protect America's technological edge with developing and promoting American AI offerings internationally to demonstrate the benefits of partnering with the United States.

Regardless of whether the administration chooses to continue or modify the Framework, we urge policymakers to continue to pursue its four core national security objectives, along with a fifth additional objective:

1. Maintain a focus on AI compute as a key enabler of AI leadership.

Compute is critical to AI leadership and remains America’s most defensible advantage. Despite recent advances in algorithmic efficiency, U.S. policymakers should continue to focus on preserving America’s compute lead.

2. Address chip smuggling to China.

Despite U.S. export restrictions, chip smuggling operations are providing the PRC with illegal access to advanced AI chips, eroding the U.S. lead. To fortify the U.S. advantage, Washington needs a better way to enforce controls and prevent smuggling.

3. Prevent competitors from overtaking the U.S. in AI, while still enabling AI diffusion.

As policymakers consider the future of the Framework, we recommend keeping cap-like restrictions on nations with the ability to leapfrog the U.S. lead (i.e. UAE and Saudi Arabia), while ensuring that any changes continue to allow easy diffusion of chips at low quantities, allowing U.S. technology to underpin AI applications globally.

4. Stop adversaries from training frontier models through the cloud.

Keeping AI chips in U.S. or allied data centers is not sufficient to ensure that advanced AI capabilities are protected from adversaries; we therefore recommend retaining the model weight protections that effectively control remote access risks. If the administration winds these protections, we alternatively recommend including know-your-customer protections for frontier levels of compute usage as a licensing condition.

5. Develop and promote U.S. AI offerings internationally.

There is an opportunity to better demonstrate the value of America as an AI partner. We recommend that restrictive measures designed to protect America's technological edge be carefully balanced with proactive initiatives to promote U.S. compute and AI offerings to allies and partners."
CNAS,Publish an Economic Security Strategy,"January 20, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/publish-an-economic-security-strategy,"The Trump administration should publish an official economic security strategy that sets a vision for the U.S. role in the global economy.

The strategy should articulate economic security goals, assess the toolkit of policy instruments available to achieve the goals, invest in enforcement capabilities, and evaluate the impact of economic security tools.

The first Trump administration championed the position that “economic security is national security” and broke with decades of bipartisan foreign economic policy, which historically had focused more on openness and efficiency than addressing security risks and resiliency. The Biden administration carried forward the shift the Trump administration had begun, introducing a diverse set of new trade and investment restrictions and pursuing industrial policies to boost domestic capacity in key sectors such as semiconductors and clean energy.

As the Trump administration returns for a second term, another flurry of economic security actions is likely. For example, the administration is expected to expand the technology controls toward China that Biden put in place and has announced plans to enact wide-ranging tariffs (see Jacob Stokes, “Articulate a Comprehensive, Coherent China Strategy” and Emily Kilcrease, “Articulate a Clear Tariffs Roadmap” in this series). But a flood of new tactical actions is no substitute for a comprehensive strategy. And absent clarity on what the United States ultimately is seeking to achieve on economic security and a vision for the U.S. role in the global economy, there is a risk that the multitude of new interventions will operate at cross-purposes, disrupting the old economic order but without building something constructive to take its place.

The Trump administration should publish an official economic security strategy. The government publishes a proliferation of strategy documents, from the broad, overarching National Security Strategy, which typically defines U.S. security interests for a new administration, to subject-specific strategies, such as recent strategies on cybersecurity and global health security.1These documents can take different forms but frequently are used to signal an administration’s priorities, define policy objectives, and outline the steps the government intends to take to achieve them.

Defining policy objectives through a strategy document will help bring discipline to the various government agencies and political appointees who will need to work together to deliver this policy agenda.

Defining policy objectives through a strategy document will help bring discipline to the various government agencies and political appointees who will need to work together to deliver this policy agenda.

The economic security strategy should include four key elements:

Set overarching economic security policy goals.The first
element is a clear and compelling articulation of the United States’ policy
objectives: What is the vision for success on economic security and a theory of
victory for realizing it? Defining policy objectives through a strategy
document will help bring discipline to the various government agencies and
political appointees who will need to work together to deliver this policy
agenda. The strategy will be useful to the extent it helps policymakers face
tradeoffs and make decisions among competing priorities. Clarity on U.S.
economic security objectives is a prerequisite for assessing whether any given
proposed policy will bring the United States closer to or farther away from its
articulated goals.

Assess the toolkit.The second key element is a holistic
inventory of the array of policy instruments the government uses to achieve its
economic security objectives. These policies are implemented by a range of
government departments and agencies; many policy instruments address similar
objectives and thus may have spillover effects on one another. For instance,
industrial policy spending under the CHIPS and Science Act, export controls,
and outbound investment restrictions are all relevant to the U.S. objective to
maintain as large a lead as possible over China in advanced semiconductor
capabilities. To better harmonize policy, the strategy should catalogue these
various instruments and match them to relevant policy objectives. As part of
this effort, it also should clarify agency roles and responsibilities in
implementing each instrument, map areas of potential overlap, and assess
whether existing coordination mechanisms are sufficient. The strategy also
should consider what, if any, broader changes to bureaucratic structure might
better facilitate harmonization.

By publishing an overarching economic security strategy, the Trump administration has the opportunity to redefine foundational principles of U.S. foreign economic policy and provide a north star to guide future policymaking.

By publishing an overarching economic security strategy, the Trump administration has the opportunity to redefine foundational principles of U.S. foreign economic policy and provide a north star to guide future policymaking.

Invest in enforcement capabilities.A third key element of the strategy is strengthening implementation and enforcement capabilities. While there has been much focus on the announcement of new controls and restrictions in recent years, these measures are only effective if government officials can credibly enforce them. Unfortunately, enforcement too often falls short—as evidenced, for instance, by nominally prohibited semiconductors continuing to be available in China and Russia. The economic security strategy should outline practical steps to strengthen enforcement to prevent bad actors from smuggling products that are export controlled, evading sanctions, and dodging tariffs by illegally transshipping goods through third countries. Critically, in some instances this may require additional resources, including to ensure policymakers have the necessary data and analytical capabilities to identify and track evasion efforts. Government officials have long complained about the outdated and cumbersome IT networks they are forced to rely on, while the private sector has made great strides in developing artificial intelligence (AI) and other analytic tools to derive insights from large data sets and better predict outcomes in complex systems. The strategy should identify pathways to bring similar capabilities inside government.

Commit to rigorous evaluation.Finally, the strategy should include a plan to rigorously evaluate economic security tools over time, to assess whether they are achieving their stated goals, and to understand how they are affecting U.S. competitiveness and technological leadership. Many of these tools are novel, or are being deployed in new and untested ways, and thus there is significant uncertainty about how they will work in practice and what impacts they will have—both intended and unintended. The strategy should identify how the government will evaluate the costs and benefits of its various economic security tools over time, including plans to incorporate lessons learned from evaluations in further refining its policies. The Trump administration has declared its intent to promote government efficiency, including by eliminating wasteful or duplicative spending; evaluation tools will help in such efforts. More importantly, evaluations will help promote governmenteffectivenesson economic security, ensuring agencies have the resources they need to achieve their objectives. The strategy also should commit the administration to release as much data and information from its evaluations to the public as possible, to empower outside researchers and analysts to independently assess the impact of economic security tools.

To date, the U.S. economic security agenda has been built piecemeal from the bottom up, as policymakers grapple reactively with emerging economic security problems and experiment with novel policy responses. And while a flexible, responsive economic security posture is essential, the lack of a clearly defined strategy to knit together disparate actions makes the current approach more whack-a-mole than comprehensive. By publishing an overarching economic security strategy, the Trump administration has the opportunity to redefine foundational principles of U.S. foreign economic policy and provide a north star to guide future policymaking.

CNAS,Securing Talent for CHIPS Act Success,"April 08, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/securing-talent-for-chips-act-success,"This commentary piece is part of CNAS’sThe Pitch: A Competition of New Ideas. The author, Connor O’Brien, won the Technology and National Security Heat at the 2024 competition.

The United States is currently engaged in a wide-ranging effort to reshore key parts of the semiconductor supply chain—a bipartisan national security priority. With the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, Congress has provided both generous subsidies and, more recently, regulatory relief for recipients of the act’s funding.1And yet comparatively little attention has been paid to talent and workforce constraints, which may ultimately determine whether the act succeeds or fails.

The U.S. chipmaking sector faces two challenges: scaling up quickly and building out the sector’s most advanced production lines domestically. Neither of these can be accomplished without rapidly upskilling and expanding the chipmaking workforce. Congress will need to consider further spending on domestic training programs beyond the down payment on such programs in the CHIPS and Science Act. But the urgency of the challenge of reshoring semiconductor production is hard to overstate—the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which would cut off the world’s main source of advanced chips, looms large.

Scaling up domestic workforce pathways will be the main way the United States builds a world-leading semiconductor workforce in the long run. But the urgency of the problem—along with the fact that many CHIPS Act–funded facilities will come online long before any domestic training programs can scale—needs Congress to leverage immigration policy for reshoring production. Not doing so not only risks the failure of CHIPS Act projects but pushes away talent that could be used to build American chip manufacturing strength to adversaries instead. Congress should therefore create a narrowly tailored Chipmaker’s Visa.2

Estimates from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology suggest the CHIPS Act will directly boost demand for high-skilled workers in semiconductor manufacturing by 20 percent.3If the act is to be successful—creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of unsubsidized factories—this increase is merely a lower bound. While estimates of so-called labor shortages deserve real scrutiny, to meet this immediate need, the United States needs better tools to retain skilled foreigners (who account for a majority of graduate students in fields relevant to semiconductors) and poach experienced talent from abroad.4The Chipmaker’s Visa could do both.

The urgency of the challenge of reshoring semiconductor production is hard to overstate—the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which would cut off the world’s main source of advanced chips, looms large.

The urgency of the challenge of reshoring semiconductor production is hard to overstate—the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which would cut off the world’s main source of advanced chips, looms large.

Employers would be able to use a Chipmaker’s Visa to sponsor workers for jobs throughout the semiconductor supply chain, from experienced engineering managers lured from South Korean firms to coveted Dutch extreme ultraviolet lithography experts. Talent needs vary from one firm to another, so the visa should not be limited to narrow occupational categories. In contrast, the H-1B visa—the country’s signature skilled immigration option—limits workers to arbitrarily defined “specialty occupations” subject to change from one presidential administration to the next, and which must be directly related to their degree field. This means that someone with an advanced degree in mathematics risks being denied a visa for work on semiconductor design. The flexibility of the Chipmaker’s Visa would send a clear message to chip manufacturers investing in the United States over the next few years that even as domestic training programs are still maturing, talent will not be a bottleneck.

For those firms new to the United States who are making first-time greenfield investments, such a visa may ease the way for getting an initial, experienced team in place. For manufacturers with an established major presence in the United States, the Chipmaker’s Visa would give them a leg up when competing with international rivals for recruits, while making it easier to retain valuable employees.

Today’s skilled immigration system makes it far too difficult for chipmakers to attract and retain talent. The H-1B visa is capped at 85,000 new recipients per year in the private sector; as the number of applicants has skyrocketed to nearly half a million for fiscal year 2025, the odds of any particular applicant winning a visa have declined.5If an American chip firm like Intel identifies a must-have engineer, the H-1B program is more likely to deny them a visa than grant them one.6

Meanwhile, for foreign-born employees already at semiconductor firms, the growing backlogs for employment-based green cards are becoming unbearable. Per-country green card caps mean Indian and Chinese nationals cannot be awarded more than 7 percent of employment-based green cards each per year; excess applicants must wait in line. As a result, some categories of Indian and Chinese nationals applying for employment-based permanent visas today will likely die still in line.7For parents on H-1B visas, such long waits for green cards often mean that their children will lose legal status when they turn 21.8To Chinese firms trying to poach talent for themselves, this is a gift courtesy of America’s dysfunctional skilled immigration system. Unsurprisingly, China in recent years has stepped up efforts to recruit chip talent trained abroad, offering bonuses of half a million dollars or more.9If the United States cannot improve its high-skilled immigration pathways for chip manufacturing talent, it will lose key workers to China and other rivals.

The flexibility of the Chipmaker’s Visa will send a clear message to chip manufacturers investing in the United States over the next few years that even as domestic training programs are still maturing, talent will not be a bottleneck.

The flexibility of the Chipmaker’s Visa will send a clear message to chip manufacturers investing in the United States over the next few years that even as domestic training programs are still maturing, talent will not be a bottleneck.

The Chipmaker’s Visa should be narrowly tailored to the problem at hand and not undercut American workers. The visa should be limited to firms in industries directly related to semiconductor manufacturing, as defined by the Department of Commerce. While Congress remains divided on the optimal size and scope of the U.S. immigration system, a small program targeted to a bipartisan priority could avoid opening contentious, big-picture debates over the broader immigration system.

Further, a Chipmaker’s Visa should be designed to allow recipients to flexibly move from one employer in the sector to another. Labor market dynamism is a key driver of productivity growth, as skilled employees take their talents from failing firms to ascendant ones.10This freedom to change employers also ensures visa holders will be paid market wages and compete fairly against American workers.

Visas could also be used to accelerate the training of native-born workers. Visas should be auctioned off by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to firms in the sector and the revenue used to train American workers. This would have two benefits. First, it would create a revenue stream to fund additional apprenticeships and scholarships beyond what was appropriated through the CHIPS Act. If the program auctions off 10,000 visas per year for an average price of $5,000—the amount one estimate suggested that H-1B visas would fetch if allocated via auction—it would raise $500 million over a decade.11That sum is more than twice the size of the CHIPS Act’s Workforce and Education Fund. Second, allocating visas through an auction prioritizes those firms who most urgently need to tap global labor markets.

In passing the CHIPS and Science Act, policymakers broke with a longstanding taboo against industrial policy because America’s overwhelming dependence on Taiwanese facilities for advanced chips was simply too great a strategic vulnerability. Taking this motivation seriously implies that policy should therefore not treat semiconductor manufacturing as just any other industry, but instead systematically seek out and dismantle barriers to its success domestically. Subsidies are just the first step.

If policymakers are serious about securing a foothold in globally competitive, leading-edge chip production for the United States as soon as possible, a skilled immigration program must be on the table. For the moment, the pool of workers and managers with relevant expertise to oversee these supply chains is globally dispersed. Over time, the CHIPS Act’s domestic investments in workforce development will pay off. But for CHIPS Act–funded projects, shovels are already in the dirt. America cannot wait years for training pipelines to mature. Congress must act now to equip the chip manufacturers making major investments in the United States with the talent they need, lest it risk undercutting the CHIPS Act before it even gets off the ground.

CNAS,Countering the Digital Silk Road: Kenya,"July 22, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/countering-the-digital-silk-road-kenya,"Project Overview

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Digital Silk Road (DSR), China’s ambitious initiative to shape critical digital infrastructure around the world to advance its geopolitical interests and technology leadership. A decade after its launch, digital infrastructure and emerging technologies have only grown more vital and contested as demand for connectivity, digital services, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) expand. Against this backdrop, the DSR has become increasingly central to China’s broader strategy to challenge and ultimately supplant the U.S.-led digital order, and in doing so, reap potentially vast security, economic, and intelligence advantages. To assess the DSR’s impact 10 years after its inception—and explore how the United States and its allies can offer a more compelling and coherent alternative—the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) Technology and National Security team has undertaken a major research project that produces in-depth case studies of four diverse and geostrategically critical nations—Indonesia,Brazil, Kenya, and Saudi Arabia—and culminates in a full-length report.

The third case study focuses on Kenya. For the study, researchers from the CNAS Technology and National Security team spent a week in the country interviewing U.S. and Kenyan policymakers, journalists, technology firms, civil society, and academics. Drawing on these interviews and desk research, this case study seeks to shed light on the current dynamics and stakes of the U.S.-China competition to shape Kenya’s digital ecosystem. It assesses the effectiveness of China’s DSR campaign vis-à-vis U.S. and allied efforts to align Kenya’s digital ecosystem with theirs in a way that advances U.S. security, economic interests, and values.

Executive Summary

In the escalating U.S.-China technology competition, policymakers too often overlook Africa.By midcentury, Africa’s digital economy could hit $712 billion.1The continent holds a third of the world’s critical mineral reserves, which are vital for semiconductors, batteries, and other advanced technologies.2Africa’s fast-growing workforce and digital economy offer significant market opportunities and first-mover advantages, comparable to Southeast Asia at the turn of the century.

Within Africa, Kenya stands out for its strategic importance.Kenya is East Africa’s political and economic leader, its finance and logistics hub, and the regional headquarters for major international organizations and foreign technology companies.The country's relative macroeconomic stability, robust democracy, internet connectivity, and business climate have all drawn significant foreign direct investment and venture capital.Kenya’s economy is now projected to exceed Ethiopia’s in 2025, despite having less than half the population.3The country’s digital sector, although small compared with established sectors such as agriculture and tourism, shows great promise.Kenya rightly touts its “Silicon Savannah,” given the breakout success of M-PESA, a mobile payments platform, along with other homegrown tech successes like Semiconductor Technologies Limited, Odoo, and Kyosk.4

Kenya’s technology potential and geopolitical importance have caught the attention of both the United States and China, which now vie to become Nairobi’s preferred partner.Both countries have ties dating back to Kenya’s independence in 1963.5The United States held the early edge with more active development assistance and security cooperation following the 1998 embassy bombings in Nairobi.6An early focus on counterterrorism expanded to intelligence-sharing and maritime security, and in 2024, Kenya became the only African country Washington has designated as a “Major Non-NATO Ally.” Rare among African countries, the United States remains Kenya’s largest export market.7

For its part, Kenya has resisted outright alignment with either Washington or Beijing.With that said, China made clear inroads with signature infrastructure projects and high-level political engagement.When Kenyan presidents Daniel arap Moi, Mwai Kibaki, and Uhuru Kenyatta pursued a “Look East” policy for alternatives to Western development financing, they found a willing partner in Beijing.8Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Nairobi in 2014, and Kenya joined the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China’s state-backed global infrastructure project, four years later.9Through the BRI, Beijing has financed major projects, such as the Nairobi Expressway and the Standard Gauge Railway.10China is now Kenya’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade rising more than 40-fold between 2000 and 2023.11Deepening investment and economic ties helped Chinese officials and firms learn local regulations, build relationships, and close key bids, bestowing powerful market advantages.

China made technology and telecommunications an early focus of its engagement with Kenya.Indeed, Kenya helped launch Beijing’s Digital Silk Road in Africa.Huawei’s very first project on the continent was a mobile network in Kenya it started in 1998.12Today, Huawei is the dominant provider for Safaricom, the country’s national telecommunications network.Generous state support has since extended China’s Digital Silk Road from telecommunications into Kenya’s smart cities, fiber-optic cables, and data center ambitions.13

Growing Chinese investment and infrastructure has undoubtedly benefited many Kenyans, but it has also sparked controversy over allegations that it fueled corruption and an unsustainable debt burden.Against this backdrop, Kenyan President William Ruto has signaled greater openness to deepening partnerships with the United States, embracing market-friendly reforms and courting American tech firms.14Although Chinese companies built much of Kenya’s physical digital infrastructure, U.S.firms continue to dominate the software and platforms Kenyans use every day, from WhatsApp to ChatGPT.Now, U.S.companies are expanding their footprint to meet Kenya’s surging demand for digital services.Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco have ramped up investments, including a $1 billion geothermal-powered data center, expanded cloud services, and skilling opportunities for AI, cybersecurity, and more.15Washington has reinforced these efforts diplomatically—President Joe Biden invited President Ruto to the White House for the first official state visit by an African leader in 16 years, where the leaders touted “a new era of technology cooperation.”16Until her departure in 2024, U.S.Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman actively championed U.S.tech partnerships with Kenya.17

The Trump administration has an opportunity to build on this progress, and it has little time to waste.Beijing has sought to capitalize on backlash to Washington’s tariff and trade policies to cast itself as a more reliable partner.18In April 2025, President Ruto made his first official visit to China, during which both countries pledged to upgrade ties to “a new level” and touted nearly $1 billion in new investments in Kenya.19

President Ruto has said he looks neither East nor West, but “forward.”20To move forward, Kenya will need strong and reliable partners to bridge connectivity gaps, strengthen cybersecurity, and support its transition to the cloud and emerging technologies like AI.In each of these domains, the United States offers formidable strengths that, if properly harnessed, can loosen Beijing’s grip on this strategic gateway to sub-Saharan Africa.

To that end, this case study offers the following recommendations for U.S.government officials and technology companies:

Strengthen commercial diplomacy with a focus on technology.The White House should nominate an ambassador with private sector tech experience, following the model of former Ambassador Whitman.The U.S.Embassy in Nairobi should expand tech “road shows” that bring senior Kenyan officials and business leaders to U.S tech hubs and expand working-level, tech-focused trade missions to and from Kenya.At the same time, the Foreign Service Institute should provide deeper technology training so diplomats can identify and win strategic digital projects abroad, and the Foreign Commercial Service should add staff in Kenya to match China’s active presence on the ground.

Seize the short-term opportunity in Kenya’s cloud migration.Kenya’s 2024 Cloud Policy mandates that all public entities adopt cloud-based solutions for information and communications technology (ICT) investments, creating an opportunity for U.S.hyperscalers to secure key public sector bids.21U.S.Embassy Nairobi should support by proactively engaging Kenyan policymakers and business leaders to emphasize the security, reliability, and long-term AI advantages of U.S.cloud services.

Surge partnership for Kenya’s Digital Superhighway Initiative.As Kenya seeks to connect every home to the internet with 62,000 miles of new fiber and 25,000 Wi-Fi hotspots, the Trump administration should prioritize diplomatic and other support for U.S.and allied firms to secure bids and loosen Huawei’s current dominance.22

Prepare for Kenya’s telecommunications modernization.Aging Huawei-built telecommunications infrastructure will eventually require replacement.The United States and its allies should lay the groundwork to offer more secure and trusted alternatives by working now to connect key Kenyan government and industry leaders with U.S.and allied vendors to explore viable alternatives, like Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) and low Earth orbit satellites, as well as financing options from the U.S.Trade and Development Agency, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and the U.S.International Development Finance Corporation.

Expand models like the Microsoft-G42 partnership to strengthen U.S. technology offerings in Kenya.The United Arab Emirates has become a valuable if imperfect partner for expanding U.S.influence in African markets.While taking precautions to safeguard sensitive U.S.technology, Washington should expand vetted partnerships like the Microsoft-G42 deal that leverage foreign capital, networks, and derisking to help U.S.firms scale in Kenya and beyond.23

Pilot a network of “Silicon Savannah Incubators” to support tech entrepreneurs and startups.These U.S.-backed tech incubators would play to America’s strengths in innovation, entrepreneurship, and fair competition. The U.S. Embassy could partner with U.S. technology firms to provide not only financial support, but also mentoring, hardware, compute access, and opportunities for tech upskilling. Alternatively, the U.S. Embassy could help scale existing incubators from American tech companies in Kenya, such as the Google for Startups Accelerator.24

Scale support for market-driven ICT skilling.The U.S.Embassy should partner with the U.S.International Trade Administration and private sector to conduct detailed forecasts of the tech sector and expand support for tech skilling initiatives that align with market trends, the needs of U.S.and allied companies, and U.S.interests, such as diversifying its supply chain for legacy chips.

Support Kenyan cybersecurity.In response to surging cyber threats, the Trump administration should foster partnerships between U.S.cybersecurity companies and the Kenyan government, critical infrastructure operators, and other key sectors.The United States and Kenya should also continue the U.S.-Kenya Cyber and Digital Dialogue, prioritizing capacity building, joint efforts to combat cybercrime, and the exchange of best practices.

Promote transparency in dealmaking through enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and support for Kenyan procurement reform.Competing with China on bribery is a losing game.The United States should double down on transparency and fair procurement.At the same time, the United States should encourage procurement reforms, fund capacity-building programs for Kenyan regulators, attach stronger transparency conditions to U.S.development financing, and leverage U.S.technology solutions where appropriate."
CNAS,Countering the Digital Silk Road: Saudi Arabia,"September 16, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/countering-the-digital-silk-road-saudi-arabia,"Project Overview

The fourth case study focuses on Saudi Arabia. For the study, researchers from the CNAS Technology and National Security team traveled to the country to interview U.S. and Saudi policymakers, personnel in technology firms, members of civil society, and academics. Drawing on these interviews and desk research, this case study seeks to shed light on the current dynamics and stakes of the U.S.-China competition to shape Saudi Arabia’s digital ecosystem.

Executive Summary

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the heavyweight of the Arab world and a rising global power. The kingdom boasts the world’s second-largest proven oil reserves and fourth-largest sovereign wealth fund. Besides Türkiye, it is the only trillion-dollar economy in the Middle East.1

Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), Saudi Arabia has gone all in on Vision 2030, an audacious initiative to diversify the petro-economy, modernize society, and expand the kingdom’s global influence. Technology is central to Vision 2030, and up to 70 percent of its goals involve data and artificial intelligence (AI).2The kingdom views emerging technologies as essential to creating good jobs, indigenizing critical industries and supply chains, and realizing Neom, the crown prince’s trillion-dollar techno-region in the country’s northwest. For all of Riyadh’s ambition, its leaders recognize that they cannot achieve Vision 2030 without foreign technology partnerships.

The United States and China are now engaged in a fierce competition to become Saudi Arabia’s preferred partner as it undertakes this historic, technology-driven transformation. Both countries seek to draw this strategic, fast-growing, and ambitious rising power closer to their respective orbits. The United States has formidable advantages: American companies enjoy a long history in the country, helping to underwrite the Saudi energy sector and introduce the first radios, televisions, and computers to the kingdom. U.S. and European countries also led the Saudi tech landscape for decades, supplying its earliest telecommunications, computers, and software.3The United States remains the kingdom’s primary security partner.

As the kingdom’s economy and ambitions grew, it embraced telecommunications as foundational to growth and modernization. To expand connectivity, Riyadh opened the door to Chinese firms, which rushed in and secured key partnerships with government agencies and domestic champions. In doing so, Chinese companies established a beachhead during the kingdom’s transition to 4G and 5G networks, eroding a longtime Western advantage as the preferred technology providers.

Through it all, China also benefited from growing tensions in U.S.-Saudi relations over policies concerning the Arab Spring, the Iran nuclear deal, civil wars in Syria and Yemen, and the assassination ofWashington Postjournalist Jamal Khashoggi. Over this period, Beijing matured from merely a large-scale energy importer and provider of cheap information and communications technology (ICT) into a genuine strategic partner. Although growing energy imports have made China the kingdom’s largest trading partner, energy is just one facet of the bilateral relationship: Companies like Huawei and Alibaba have also expanded their offerings from telecommunications to smart cities, cloud infrastructure, and AI.4Two-way investment in each country’s tech sector has also grown, although it pales in comparison to capital flows between Saudi Arabia and the United States.5The kingdom is now a pillar of China’s Digital Silk Road (DSR), punctuating a remarkable turnaround given that the countries only normalized relations in 1990.

The United States and China are now engaged in a fierce competition to become Saudi Arabia’s preferred partner as it undertakes this historic, technology-driven transformation.

The United States and China are now engaged in a fierce competition to become Saudi Arabia’s preferred partner as it undertakes this historic, technology-driven transformation.

The kingdom’s proactive embrace of digital infrastructure has paid dividends. The country has connected 99 percent of its population, with median mobile speeds that are roughly double the global average.6In 2024, the Saudi government touted its emergence as the largest and fastest-growing digital economy in the Middle East.7Riyadh now sees technology—and especially AI—as the engine of further progress, and it seeks to dramatically expand its domestic data center capacity, semiconductor design and fabrication ecosystem, and AI adoption. It now seeks foreign partners to realize these ambitions.

The United States has a strong hand to play. Washington’s challenge is meeting Saudi demand without compromising sensitive U.S. technologies, offshoring leadership at the AI frontier, or enabling greater digital authoritarianism. At the same time, Riyadh will likely resist Washington’s efforts to force outright alignment with the U.S. technology ecosystem, given its fast-maturing relationship with Beijing. Still, there is considerable opportunity for U.S. officials and industry to draw on their technological, political, and reputational advantages to outcompete China’s DSR in the heart of Arabia. To that end, this report offers the following recommendations for U.S. officials:

Conclude a secure, phased, and verifiable deal with Saudi Arabia for advanced AI chips.As of September 2025, the Trump administration’s agreement with Saudi Arabia to expand access to advanced AI chips remains under negotiation. Under its initial terms, the Saudi AI champion Humain could purchase hundreds of thousands of advanced NVIDIA and AMD chips to build a 1 gigawatt (GW) data center.The administration has considerable leverage: Huawei’s Ascend chips are less performant and less available for foreign deployment, given compute shortages within China. Unlike many emerging markets, leaders in Riyadh strongly prefer best-in-class offerings, and U.S. companies dominate the AI stack. Put simply, Saudi Arabia needs American AI more than America needs Saudi capital. This presents a strategic but potentially fleeting opportunity for the United States to secure its place as the kingdom’s preferred AI partner.At the same time, the administration should proceed only if all Saudi recipients of AI chips, like Humain, meet the following conditions.Highest standards of physical and cybersecurityRigorous background checks and insider threat training for employeesKnow-your-customer verificationGuarantees for U.S. companies to deploy, maintain, and oversee the majority of AI chips in Saudi data centersAssurance and verification that U.S.-designed AI chips do not power applications that facilitate human rights abuses and repressionCessation of partnerships and other support for Chinese firms related to strategic technologies like AIRegular audits accounting for AI chip locations and usesDivestment of Chinese technology and telecommunications vendors from core digital infrastructure and services related to U.S. security and intelligence cooperation

Highest standards of physical and cybersecurity

Rigorous background checks and insider threat training for employees

Know-your-customer verification

Guarantees for U.S. companies to deploy, maintain, and oversee the majority of AI chips in Saudi data centers

Assurance and verification that U.S.-designed AI chips do not power applications that facilitate human rights abuses and repression

Cessation of partnerships and other support for Chinese firms related to strategic technologies like AI

Regular audits accounting for AI chip locations and uses

Divestment of Chinese technology and telecommunications vendors from core digital infrastructure and services related to U.S. security and intelligence cooperation

A phased approach to a U.S.-Saudi AI deal, whereby chips are released in smaller batches over time, would allow for accountability and trust building. The Trump administration’s July 2025 AI Action Plan created a mechanism for industry-led consortia to receive government approval for “full-stack” AI exports through a new program at the Department of Commerce.8The administration should encourage consortia to develop packages for Saudi Arabia and condition approval based on similar requirements.



Support the expansion of Saudi fabrication capacity for legacy chips while limiting support for leading-edge semiconductor design tools and research.The United States should welcome increased Saudi capacity to fabricate legacy chips to diversify its supply chains from China, and it should encourage industry and research partnerships to that end. At the same time, Washington should not undermine its leverage by enabling advanced chip design and fabrication in Saudi Arabia and other nations that lack treaty-level alignment with the United States. For now, the kingdom does not seek capabilities in leading-edge chip fabrication and has focused more on legacy node chip fabrication and fostering a fabless design ecosystem.

Establish a process to fast-track inbound investments from allied and partner sources for U.S. strategic technologies.This could align with the Trump administration’s February 2025 America First Investment Policy.9Reforms should streamline application criteria, shorten review times, expand dedicated personnel and resources, and include rigorous standards for intellectual property (IP) protection, cybersecurity, personnel background checks, and divestment from Chinese firms in strategic technology sectors or with links to the military or security services. The administration could also consider a “clean capital” designation for firms that disclose and divest links to adversary-linked firms, expediting approvals.

Leverage people-to-people ties to support Riyadh’s Saudization policies.Saudis are more likely to study at U.S. universities, know Western business practices, and speak English instead of Mandarin. This helps U.S. firms align with Riyadh’s efforts to boost Saudi hiring and upskill local talent. But this advantage will fade with time. The Chinese government has waived visas for Saudi citizens and expanded Mandarin offerings in the kingdom. Chinese companies are also increasing local hiring and upskilling.To expand America’s people-to-people edge, higher education institutions with active partnerships in Saudi Arabia should expand curricula related to AI and emerging technologies. The Trump administration could prioritize Saudi talent in a new Young Technology Leaders Initiative—modeled on the successful Young African Leaders Initiative—to identify the next generation of promising global talent and strengthen ties with the U.S. ecosystem.10

Engage the Saudi Communications, Space, and Technology Commission about the draft Global AI Hub Law.Engagement should prioritize designating American-operated data centers in Saudi Arabia as “data embassies” that allow for limited U.S. administrative jurisdiction. This would facilitate compliance with U.S. export controls, spot inspections to curb diversion and unauthorized access, workload attestations, and other oversight mechanisms.

Pilot a joint effort by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State, and the Department of Energy (DOE) to bolster AI data center security in strategic overseas markets.The Trump administration’s July 2025 AI Action Plan called for the DHS to create guidance for the private sector to remediate and respond to “AI-specific vulnerabilities and threats.”11Once this process concludes, the DHS should work with the State Department and the DOE to share best practices with Saudi Arabia and other strategic partners with ambitions for large-scale AI and related energy infrastructure.

Support eventual Saudi transition to 6G through research partnerships.6G is expected to be the first AI-native telecommunications architecture, with built-in support for intelligent routing and edge-based inference—areas where the United States and its allies remain competitive. If the United States concludes agreements for full-stack AI exports and broader strategic partnerships with the kingdom, it will be better positioned to displace Huawei’s ubiquitous presence in existing Saudi telecommunications networks down the line. In July 2024, Ericsson extended a research and development partnership with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology through 2026 to advanced 5G and 6G. Other U.S. and allied companies should pursue similar partnerships with Neom, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, the Saudi Telecom Company, and other key players ahead of the 6G transition.12"

Through this submission, the authors respond to the NTIA’s request for comments on “the challenges surrounding data center growth, resilience and security in the United States amidst a surge of computing power demand due to the development of critical and emerging technologies” (NTIA–2024–0002). The authors comments focus on the relevance of data centers for AI.

Recommendations:

Address domestic energy bottlenecks by fast tracking permitting and increasing incentives for AI data center energy construction.

Work with the private sector, AI Safety Institutes (AISIs), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA) and other government agencies to develop and implement data center security standards proportionate to emerging risks.

Incentivize research and development for hardware-enabled security and governance features on AI chips.

To the extent possible, coordinate with international partners on AI data center security and governance, while safeguarding U.S. technology.

Work closely with competition agencies and AI experts to assess and, as appropriate, intervene to shape dynamics in the market for advanced compute provided by leading data centers to encourage competition and innovation across the AI stack."
CNAS,Stop Obsessing Over AGI,"July 30, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/stop-obsessing-over-agi,"This article was originally published onThe Center Square.The White House’s recent AI Action Plan omits three letters: AGI. That’s a good thing. America's AI policy must move past its narrow fixation on an arbitrary term – relevant perhaps to industry insiders, but irrelevant to the core questions that should guide national AI development and deployment.

Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, lacks a clear definition. Most attempts focus on AI’s hypothetical ability to outperform humans across nearly all tasks, implying profound societal disruption once this threshold is reached. For example, AGI is seen as signaling a rapid and widespread displacement of jobs. Some even forecast that AGI will usher in a world in which AI not only matches human intelligence but surpasses it, putting humans in a permanent subordinate role to machines.

What’s lacking? Thoughtful, deliberate, and evidence-based deployment and adoption strategies.

CNAS,The United States Must Avoid AI’s Chernobyl Moment,"March 10, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/the-united-states-must-avoid-ais-chernobyl-moment,"In January, U.S President Donald Trump tasked his advisors to develop by July 2025 an AI Action Plan, a roadmap intended to “sustain and enhance America’s AI dominance.” This call to action mirrors the early days of nuclear energy — a transformative technology with world-changing potential but also grave risks. Much like the nuclear industry was derailed by public backlash following disasters such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, AI could face a similar crisis of confidence unless policymakers take proactive steps to prevent a large-scale incident.

A single large-scale AI disaster—be it in cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, or biotechnology—could undermine public trust, stall innovation, and leave the United States trailing global competitors. Recent reports indicate plans to cut the government’s AI capacity by dismantling the AI Safety Institute. But this would be a self-inflicted wound—not only for safety, but for progress. If Washington fails to anticipate and mitigate major AI risks, the United States risks falling behind in the fallout from what could become AI’s Chernobyl moment.

The United States cannot let speculative fears trigger heavy-handed regulations that would cripple U.S. AI innovation.

The United States cannot let speculative fears trigger heavy-handed regulations that would cripple U.S. AI innovation.

For many Americans, AI’s transformative promise today echoes the optimism around nuclear power in the early 1970s, when more than half of the public supported its expansion. Yet the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island—a partial reactor meltdown—shattered that optimism, with support for nuclear energy dropping precipitously by the mid-1980s. By 1984, nearly two-thirds of Americans opposed the expansion of nuclear energy. Statistical analysis suggests that the Three Mile Island incident was associated with a 72 percent decline in nuclear reactor construction globally. Following the deadlier 1986 Chernobyl incident, countries were more than 90 percent less likely to build nuclear power plants than prior to this accident.

Just as many nations envisioned a renaissance for nuclear energy, the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan triggered renewed public skepticism and policy reversals. Fukushima — the only nuclear disaster besides Chernobyl to ever reach the highest classification on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale — caused public support for nuclear energy to plummet around the world. The Japanese government halted all plans for new nuclear reactors. Germany shut down all 17 of its nuclear power generation facilities, ultimately leading to increased dependence on Russian fossil fuels, compromising both its energy security and climate goals. The world is still paying the opportunity cost today: Limited access to clean, reliable nuclear power remains a critical bottleneck for AI development and other energy-intensive innovations.Read the full article onJust Security."
CNAS,Biopower,"January 15, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/biopower,"Executive Summary

The biorevolution is upon us. Converging breakthroughs in biological sequencing, engineering biology, and machine learning are ushering in an almost science fiction–like world in which humans can manipulate and even design the building blocks of life with increasing sophistication—for good or ill. In this world, cutting-edge biotechnologies will create organs, capture carbon emissions, restore polluted environments, tailor medicines to a person’s genes, and replace vulnerable supply chains for food, fuel, fabrics, and firepower with domestic biobased alternatives. According to one estimate, existing biotechnologies could have a direct economic impact of $4 trillion a year for the next 20 years.1As innovation continues, the ceiling could be far higher.If next-generation biotechnologies hold great promise, they also come with gathering perils from new bioweapons, intrusive biosurveillance, and the race for biotechnology breakthroughs without adequate safeguards for public health, the environment, and democratic values. For policymakers, the question is not whether the biorevolution has transformative power, but which nation will responsibly harness that power to unlock new tools for defense, health, manufacturing, food security, environmental remediation, and the fight against climate change. No country is better positioned to lead the biorevolution than the United States, but it requires that policymakers act now with swift, ambitious, and far-sighted steps to secure America’s place as the global biopower.The United States enters the biorevolution with formidable tailwinds—an unrivaled innovation ecosystem, world-leading research institutes, unmatched private investment, talent, and a global network of democratic partners and allies. Recent federal investments and an emerging policy framework have fortified U.S. leadership. But in this fast-moving field, settling for gradual progress will guarantee falling behind as competitors like China race to eclipse the United States with ambitions to scale up their biotechnology research, innovation, talent, and infrastructure.

To secure America’s place as the global biopower, the Trump administration and Congress should accelerate U.S. tailwinds through greater investment in biotechnology research and infrastructure, especially in sectors beyond health and medicine; expand the pipeline of biotalent; and lead globally to drive biotechnology norms, standards-setting, and responsible adoption. At the same time, policymakers must navigate headwinds that could imperil further progress—specifically, an underdeveloped national biomanufacturing infrastructure; insufficient public and private investment that flows overwhelmingly to biotechnology research and development (R&D) in the health and medical sectors; a lack of uniform federal standards, definitions, and codes; a morass of conflicting policies and regulations; inaccessible and insecure biodata; and low public awareness and trust in emerging and ethically fraught biotechnology applications. This report outlines several recommendations to shore up America’s position as the preeminent biopower, including an investment of $20 billion in new federal funding. Policymakers should view this level of investment as the floor of what it will require to secure U.S. biotechnology leadership.

Cutting-edge biotechnologies will create organs, capture carbon emissions, restore polluted environments, tailor medicines to a person’s genes, and replace vulnerable supply chains for food, fuel, fabrics, and firepower with domestic biobased alternatives.

The United Kingdom (UK) is driving innovation by concentrating and sharing its biodata through the UK Biobank, which houses the fully sequenced genetic codes of 500,000 people.2France has invested roughly $9.5 billion through Innovation Santé 2030 to drive biomedical research.3Japan has committed $3 billion to promote its biotechnology ecosystem.4South Korea is carving out a niche in digital biotechnology and aims to transition 30 percent of its manufacturing industry to biomanufacturing within a decade.5

If any nation can surpass the United States as the global biopower, it will be China. In its most recent five-year plans, Beijing made explicit its ambition to become a biotechnology “superpower.” It is well on its way. China’s biotechnology leadership has surged on the back of significant public investment, long-term policy prioritization, a massive domestic market, decades of largely unrestricted capital flows, and the amassing of biodata through licit and illicit means.6China’s concerted biotechnology push has already paid dividends: its scholars rank second in the world for authoring biomedical papers, and the country leads high-impact research in biofuels and biomanufacturing. China’s high-impact research in synthetic biology is more than triple that of the United States, posing a high risk of monopolization.7Today, China is a global biomanufacturing powerhouse that exports roughly 40 percent of the world’s active pharmaceutical ingredients.8Now, China aspires to move up the biotechnology value chain with a renewed push to support start-ups, integrate its vast biodata with cutting-edge machine learning tools, and dominate emerging markets for biotechnology with “national champions” such as BGI Group and WuXi Biologics, as it did with Huawei and 5G.China’s ambition to close the gap with the United States should inspire action from policymakers to secure and extend America’s lead. To that end, this report outlines a series of immediate and longer-term recommendations in six key areas for leaders in policymaking and industry:

Invest in Research and Infrastructure

While the private sector largely drives biotechnology innovation, federal support is vital to general biotechnology R&D—especially in applications beyond health and medicine. To level up American biopower, policymakers should significantly expand public investment in biotechnology-related research, development, and infrastructure through the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Institute of Standards and Technology and support agency-led efforts to realize the March 2023Bold Goals for Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing. Wherever possible, investments should seek to close the gap between the biomedical and biopharmaceutical sectors—which receive the lion’s share of public and private investment—and other promising biotechnology applications in areas such as defense, energy, and manufacturing. At the same time, the federal government should better coordinate and strategically target existing and future investments in general and applied biotechnology research. Finally, policymakers should consider financial and tax incentives to attract private capital to sustain biotechnology ventures across the Valley of Death, with a focus on biotechnology ventures in defense, manufacturing, energy, and agriculture.

Expand Biotalent

American biopower hinges on world-class biotalent in government, academia, and industry. Although the United States has a relative advantage in access to top STEM talent, it still faces a shortage that impedes progress. Industry should intensify engagement with secondary and postsecondary educational institutions to build early interest in biotechnology careers, expand internship and apprenticeship opportunities, and align curricula with anticipated biotechnology jobs. Policymakers should also pursue targeted immigration reform to supercharge the flow of top biotalent to U.S. research institutions and companies—paired with efforts to shore up research security—while acting to broaden biotalent and bioliteracy across government by leveraging initiatives such as the Presidential Innovation Fellowship and the U.S. Digital Service.

Unlock Biodata

Biotech leadership hinges on secure, quality biodata. However, biodata is too often segmented and sequestered in public and private labs according to different protocols with incompatible systems. Policymakers should clarify and modernize regulations for the use of artificial intelligence–ready health and genomic data for biotechnology research; invest in privacy-preserving and privacy-enhancing technology to promote large-scale biodata analysis while respecting privacy; establish a new American Biobank modeled on the successful UK Biobank; and fortify the cybersecurity of biodata repositories in government and private hospitals and clinics.

Strengthen and Streamline Policy

To the extent they exist, biotechnology standards, definitions, and regulations are outdated, inconsistent, and incoherent—sapping innovation. Policymakers should require a government-wide survey to identify regulatory gaps and develop uniform federal definitions, standards, and codes for biotechnology and the bioeconomy to improve tracking, measurement, and coordination. They should also establish a consolidated federal office to provide a single point of entry for biotechnology regulations and direct most federal agencies to develop strategies for aligning their various programs, investments, and outreach to drive responsible biotechnology innovation and broader biotechnology competitiveness.

Lead Globally

The United States should fully exercise its global leadership to shape the future of biotechnology. As with artificial intelligence (AI), Washington’s decisions in the next few years could determine whether next-generation biotechnologies will reflect democratic values or techno-authoritarianism. To that end, policymakers should convene a global Biotechnology Safety and Opportunity Summit modeled after the success of the UK’s 2023 Bletchley AI Safety Summit; set a global example by declaring red lines for unacceptable biotechnology research and applications; and develop a strategy for biotechnology standards-setting and joint research through existing partnerships such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States trilateral security partnership (AUKUS); and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad).

Build Public Trust

Strong and sustained U.S. biotechnology leadership requires enduring support from policymakers and the public. However, both groups remain broadly unaware of the looming biorevolution and its consequences for America’s economy, security, and values. To elevate and broaden the debate, industry should hold a national summit on the bioeconomy to make the case for why biotechnology leadership is essential to U.S. national, health, and economic security, and highlight biotechnology’s positive applications. Senior executive branch leaders should crisscross the country and make the case for U.S. biotechnology leadership. For its part, Congress should hold regular biotechnology hearings and engage constituents to boost awareness among public and elected officials.

The biorevolution holds great promise and risk, and the ultimate balance will hinge largely on America’s choices in the coming years. Policymakers must embrace the biorevolution with ambition and humility, acting boldly to drive research, innovation, and infrastructure across the full spectrum of biotechnologies; reform policy; train, attract, and retain biotalent; responsibly unlock biodata; leverage global partnerships; and earn public trust. The United States led the 20th century in biotechnology, and there is no reason it cannot lead the 21st as the preeminent global biopower.

Chapter 1: The Biorevolution

If the 20th century saw the Information Revolution, the 21st is witnessing the biorevolution—a dizzying future in which humanity can design and manipulate the building blocks of life with greater precision, for good or ill. Propelled by converging breakthroughs in synthetic biology, biological engineering, biocomputing, and more, the biorevolution will have far-reaching consequences for the global economic and security landscape, even if those impacts remain poorly understood by policymakers and the public.

With emerging biotechnologies and techniques, humans can now shape life for our ends with increasing sophistication.

With emerging biotechnologies and techniques, humans can now shape life for our ends with increasing sophistication.

The biorevolution rests on a powerful and unsettling truth: the building blocks of life, such as DNA and RNA, are programmable. With emerging biotechnologies and techniques, humans can now shape life for our ends with increasing sophistication—with the potential for better crops, livestock, materials, medicines, and manufacturing, along with powerful new tools to promote food and energy security, power the economy, safeguard the environment, and protect Americans from future pandemics and biothreats. Biology is transitioning from a longtime scientific discipline of observation and measurement to a domain of human design.9

The United States has pushed the frontier of biotechnology for decades. In the 1970s, American scientists developed recombinant DNA technology, unlocking medical advances such as monoclonal antibodies and insulin treatments for diabetes.10In the 1980s, American biochemist Kary Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—a foundational tool in modern genetics that allows researchers to reproduce DNA sequences.11Between 1990 and 2003, America spearheaded the Human Genome Project, a landmark scientific collaboration that generated the first nearly complete sequence of all three billion base pairs of the human genome.12A decade later, Jennifer Doudna earned a Nobel Prize for helping to pioneer gene editing technology with CRISPR-Cas9.13More recently, Drew Weissman helped lay the groundwork for the mRNA (messenger RNA) COVID-19 vaccine, which saved millions of lives.14

In its simplest form, biotechnology is the manipulation of biology to create services and products.

Although the United States led the world in biotechnology in the 20th century, there is no guarantee it will remain the global biopower in the 21st. America’s competitors, especially China, grasp biotechnology’s potential to enhance economic and military power and have moved proactively to realize it. In fact, China has already surpassed the United States in trials for CAR T-cell therapy—a promising cancer treatment.15As the world’s current biotechnology leader, the United States still enjoys the strongest hand to become the 21st century biopower, propelled by natural tailwinds from its innovative private sector, premier research institutions, and dynamic capital markets. These advantages are no reason for the United States to rest on its laurels. Ambitious competitors and gathering domestic headwinds risk seriously eroding U.S. biotechnology leadership without significant changes to policies and investments today.

At a time when many emerging technologies compete for limited attention and resources, there is value in clarifying the benefits of U.S. biotechnology leadership and the dangers of ceding it to competitors. This report will make the national and economic security case for U.S. biotechnology leadership; review the history, recent developments, and priority issues in U.S. biotechnology policy; identify tailwinds and headwinds to U.S. biotechnology leadership; and assess biotechnology-leading nations abroad, from close partners to strategic competitors such as China. Finally, the report will outline recommendations in six key areas to secure America’s place as the 21st century biopower.

Biotechnology, Biomanufacturing, and the Bioeconomy

Biotechnology’s cross-cutting breadth, rapid advancements, and technical complexity can make it hard for policymakers and the public to grasp. In its simplest form, biotechnology is the manipulation of biology to create services and products. These range from precision medicine tailored to an individual’s DNA to genetically engineered crops that better resist drought and disease to alternative proteins; mRNA vaccines; and biobased armor, resins, fabrics, and fuel. If “biotechnology” captures the range of technology-based techniques and tools, then “biomanufacturing” is its application to create specific products.16By extension, the term “bioeconomy” captures the economic activity generated from every product, service, and process derived from biological resources, even if they do not use biotechnologies.17According the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), in 2016, the bioeconomy accounted for more than 5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)—nearly $1 trillion.18An estimate from McKinsey & Company predicts that biological processes could generate up to 60 percent of all physical inputs in the global economy, with a direct economic impact of up to $4 trillion annually between 2030 and 2040.19

Biotechnology-enabled mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives in the United States and trillions of dollars in further economic harm.

Biotechnology-enabled mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives in the United States and trillions of dollars in further economic harm.

Historically, discussion of biotechnology and the bioeconomy tends to focus on research, development, and applications in the health, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors—reflecting biotechnology’s overwhelming share of public and private investment and activity. This report, however, will embrace a broader conception of biotechnology and the bioeconomy to reference the full spectrum of applications in health, energy, agriculture, and defense.

The world has already reaped many benefits from the biorevolution, from genetically engineered crops that are hardier and more nutritious to stem cell treatments for leukemia and sickle cell anemia to advanced biofuels that have boosted energy security and reduced carbon emissions. It took the Human Genome Project 13 years and $2.7 billion to sequence the human genome.20Today, cutting-edge machines can do this in less than a day, for less than $1,000—and by the end of the decade, perhaps, for less than $100.21The COVID-19 pandemic exacted a terrible toll—more than 1.5 million American lives lost and $5 trillion in federal spending—but it is worth imagining how much worse it would have been without biotechnology-enabled vaccines and the biotechnology-powered ability to sequence the virus within weeks.22The pandemic was a painful but powerful demonstration of biotechnology’s power to save millions of lives and trillions of dollars.

KEY DEFINITIONS

Biotechnology:Technology that manipulates biology to create products and services, such as gene editing.

Biomanufacturing:The application of biotechnology-based techniques and tools to create specific products, such as biobased armor, fabrics, and fuel.

Bioeconomy:The economic activity generated from every product, service, and process derived from biological resources, even if it does not use biotechnologies.

Key Trends and Technologies

Although the biorevolution has gathered momentum for years, several converging trends will continue its acceleration: the collapsing cost of computing power, gene sequencing, and gene synthesis; the increasing sophistication and digitization of medical testing and records, which will dramatically expand biodata; and the rise of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools. These trends have combined to give scientists and industries more biodata to analyze at lower cost and with greater power and precision.

These converging trends have powered biotechnology breakthroughs in several areas. Although detailing each breakthrough is beyond the scope of this report, policymakers should pay particular attention to developments in three key, often overlapping, areas: biological sequencing, engineering biology/synthetic biology, and human-machine interfaces.23

Biological sequencing.This field includes efforts to map, measure, and analyze biological molecules and pathways. The most consequential subset is the sequencing of genes, the instructions for building and maintaining the cells in living organisms. When arranged in a sequence, genes form strands of DNA, one of the building blocks of life. Advances in biological sequencing therefore bestow greater insights into the design and function of life, with far-reaching applications, from understanding novel biothreats, such as the COVID-19 virus, to developing personalized medicine to designing new biobased materials and manufacturing processes. Other promising subfields include the sequencing of proteins, metabolites, the microbiome, and RNA transcripts—the molecules that help regulate the flow of genetic information within cells.

Engineering biology/synthetic biology.These terms are often used interchangeably, but they have important distinctions. Whereas engineering biology is the application of engineering principles to existing biological systems to develop products, synthetic biology uses modern biotechnologies and techniques to create entirely novel biological systems. For example, manipulating the DNA of a cotton plant would fall under engineering biology, while synthetic biology would entail designing the DNA of a new and improved cotton plant de novo.

Biological engineering spans revolutionary gene editing technologies from CRISPR and TALEN to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, which use mRNA technology.24Applications include lab-grown meat and bioengineered materials such as plant-based fibers, polymers, and coatings.

The pandemic was a painful but powerful demonstration of biotechnology’s power to save millions of lives and trillions of dollars.

The pandemic was a painful but powerful demonstration of biotechnology’s power to save millions of lives and trillions of dollars.

Engineering biology techniques are also increasingly used to enhance regenerative medicine, which involves repairing, replacing, or regenerating damaged cells, tissues, and organs.25Among the most promising advances in regenerative medicine is stem cell research, in which scientists use stem cells to 3-D print organic tissue and biobased materials.26In a decade or more, some experts envision a world of 3-D printed organs for human transplant.27In fact, British doctors have already successfully implanted a 3-D printed eye in a patient and 3-D printed bladders that saved the lives of three children.28

Biological engineering and synthetic biology hold immense potential. Future breakthroughs could allow societies to complement chemical- and petroleum-based materials with bioengineered materials with a lower environmental impact, just as they could complement conventional, carbon-intensive meats with lab-grown alternatives. They could provide healthy lungs, livers, kidneys, eyes, and other organs to any patient who needs them, and replace or regenerate diseased cells to treat sickle cell anemia and cardiovascular disease.29None of these breakthroughs are imminent; indeed, some may be decades away. But given their potential, companies and countries would be unwise to ignore them.

Human-machine interfaces.This field sits at the intersection of organic biosystems (such as human organs) and inorganic systems (such as software and hardware). The most common applications are in the medical field, in which devices can create one- or two-way communications with parts of the body. For example, doctors can now place sensors on the scalp or implant them on the brain (“brain-computer interface”) to read a patient’s neural signals and control a robotic arm or a device cursor.30Other biomachines can send electronic signals to the brain (“deep brain stimulation”) to modulate unusual neural activity and help manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, or to help treat attention deficit disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and severe depression.31Similarly, a cochlear implant in the ear sends electronic signals to stimulate the auditory nerve and improve hearing.32Although this field has seen less progress than biological sequencing and biological engineering, there is growing potential for medical applications. These include neuroprosthetics to restore lost senses through technologies such as bionic vision, or technologies to direct a prosthetic limb with signals from the brain.33Last year, Elon Musk’s company Neuralink made headlines for successfully implanting a chip onto a patient’s brain, reportedly restoring some mobility.34Neuralink was not the first successful implantation of a neural chip, and it won’t be the last.35In September 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Neuralink’s Blindsight device, which Musk claims could one day restore limited vision to certain people who are blind, for accelerated development.36In time, biotechnology may be able to restore sight, hearing, and movement for millions—improving quality of life and productivity.

KEY FIELDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY

Biological sequencing:Efforts to map, measure, and analyze biological molecules and pathways. This includes sequencing not only genes but also proteins, metabolites, and RNA transcripts.

Engineering biology/synthetic biology:Engineering biology is the application of engineering principles to existing biological systems to develop products. Synthetic biology uses modern biotechnologies and techniques to create entirely novel biological systems.

Human-machine interfaces:This field sits at the intersection of organic biosystems, such as organs, and inorganic systems, such as software and hardware. This field includes devices that can create one- or two-way communication with parts of the body, such as Neuralink.

Developments in these three areas—biological sequencing, biological engineering/synthetic biology, and human-machine interfaces—will converge with other technology trends, especially the rapid expansion of advanced computing power and advanced AI tools and automation. According to AI research organization Epoch AI, from 1950 to 2010, it took almost two years to double computing power. But since 2010, it now takes only six months.37Today, computing costs are up to 1,000 times cheaper than they were two decades ago.38New machine learning techniques combined with the proliferation of biodata could allow researchers to extract transformative insights in health, medicine, agriculture, energy, and more.

The National Security Case for U.S. Biotechnology Leadership

As with any technological breakthrough, bad actors will seize on the biorevolution’s new tools and capabilities for their own nefarious ends. The same techniques that can sequence a deadly virus to develop a vaccine could also reveal how to make that virus even deadlier. The techniques to genetically manipulate staple crops to make them more resilient could yield insights about how to destroy them. The power to manipulate life inevitably unlocks the power to destroy it. Beyond direct threats to human security lie more fundamental questions about the dangers and ethics of “playing God” by treating DNA and RNA—the building blocks of life itself—as little more than computer code to manipulate for human ends.

Any qualms about the biorevolution should be tempered with the reality of its arrival. It is not a question of whether the biorevolution will happen, but which nations will lead it, shape it, and reap its benefits. The United States continues to lead the world in biotechnology, but China races to close the gap. Beijing has named biotechnology a strategic emerging industry, and it has already hit its 10-year targets. According to some estimates, China has invested up to $100 billion in life sciences research and development (R&D) at the local, provincial, and national levels.39Leading Chinese biotechnology companies are also amassing vast genomic and health data, and the government’s prioritization of the sector has offered a strong signal for research and market investment.40

It is not realistic for the United States to out-compete China in every sector. Federal actions to protect and support certain sectors require a clear-eyed assessment of their importance to national security. The national security case for U.S. biotechnology leadership rests on five core arguments.

First, a strong biotechnology sector will better protect the nation’s citizens and economy from new pandemics and biothreats—both natural and human created. The COVID-19 pandemic painfully underscored the danger of unchecked viruses to the safety of America’s citizens and economy. A robust biotechnology sector will put the United States in a stronger position to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate future outbreaks and biothreats with the latest tools for virus detection, sequencing, and vaccine development. To weigh the value of a robust domestic biotechnology sector, consider a world in which the United States must rely on China for lifesaving vaccines for the next pandemic or a neglected U.S. biotechnology sector can only produce those vaccines months—or even years—later than foreign competitors. Beyond this, biotechnology has the potential to deliver breakthroughs to restore vision, sight, and movement through neuroprosthetics; tailored wellness and dieting regimes through personalized medicine; and precision treatments for sickle cell anemia and cardiovascular disease to improve the longevity, health, and productivity of Americans. Embracing the biorevolution could also avoid a future in which the United States must rely on competitors such as China for mission-critical materials for the U.S. military, clean energy breakthroughs, or cutting-edge tools to protect its population from novel pandemics and biothreats.41

The power to manipulate life inevitably unlocks the power to destroy it.

The power to manipulate life inevitably unlocks the power to destroy it.

Second, ceding the biorevolution to competitors risks depriving the United States of potentially transformative defense applications. Breakthroughs in biotechnology could provide renewable sources of jet fuel.42They could promote the physical and mental health of service members through products that help balance their microbiomes, enable self-repairing airfields with “living concrete” full of bacteria that regenerate to fill cracks as they emerge, and better protect soldiers with armor made of “dragon silk”—a genetically engineered spider silk that is not only lighter but up to three times tougher than traditional Kevlar.43The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) could employ new, lighter, and flame-retardant biological resins to improve the designs of drones, ships, and aircraft.44Biological sensors could provide real-time alerts to hazardous biological or chemical agents.45Researchers have manipulated theE. colibacteria into a biosensor that can detect unexploded ordnance, reducing risks to both service members and civilians.46Biotechnology’s defense applications are as far ranging as the field itself.47

Third, the biorevolution will bestow significant economic benefits to nations that harness it. Like AI, biotechnology could level up major sectors of the economy—from agriculture and pharmaceuticals to textiles, energy, and manufacturing. If the United States fails to invest in biotechnology, it risks missing out on the new tools, processes, and productivity it could unlock—and the billions, even trillions, of dollars in economic benefit. McKinsey & Company forecasts thatexistingbiotechnology applications could have up to $4 trillion in annual, direct economic impact over the next 20 years.48In addition, the World BioEconomy Forum estimates that the broad adoption of synthetic biology techniques in manufacturing could account for more than one-third of all global output—or nearly $30 trillion.49

Biotechnology can also strengthen domestic supply chains, for example, through biologically engineered crops that increase food security, a robust bioproduction capacity to strengthen national security supply chains, and a strong biopharmaceutical sector to ensure access to breakthrough vaccines and treatments in the event of new pandemics and biothreats.50The biorevolution could also enable more resilient supply chains that promote broad-based economic growth. Today, manufacturing processes often rely on imported chemical inputs, exposing them to external supply chain shocks. By contrast, biomanufacturing relies on organic biomass ranging from agricultural byproducts such as animal waste to forestry byproducts like bark and wood chips. Unlike imported chemical inputs, these bio-inputs are renewable, domestically sourced, and broadly distributed across the country. As such, biomanufacturing facilities could be colocated with farms, forests, and municipal waste sites across the country, driving new jobs and investments in more remote and rural communities.

Fourth, biotechnology could unlock powerful tools to fight climate change and promote energy security. Climate change threatens U.S. national security in myriad ways, from direct harm to citizens from extreme weather to increased geopolitical instability from persistent drought and extreme heat.51As Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said, “No nation can find lasting security without addressing the climate crisis.”52Fortunately, experts predict biotechnologies could someday yield advanced biofuels to significantly reduce emissions in transport, industry, and agriculture.53Organic biomass—everything from fallen trees to food waste to farm products—is an abundant, renewable energy source. However, converting biomass to fuel still requires an expensive process of breaking down the cell walls into sugars and converting those sugars into fuel. Biofuel proponents hope advances in synthetic biology can streamline this process and make biofuels a more compelling alternative. Biotechnology also holds promise for carbon reduction and sequestration—from carbon-absorbing microalgae to genetically modified trees that pull more carbon dioxide from the air to genetically modified crops that require less energy-intensive fertilizers.54As the urgency of tackling climate change and achieving energy security grows, so does the case for developing biotechnology-powered tools to advance these goals.

Biotechnology can also transform industrial processes to become less carbon intensive. For example, BDO (1,4-Butanediol) is a widely used chemical for manufacturing plastics and fibers. Companies such as Genomatica are developing biobased alternatives to BDO that use the fermentation of renewable feedstocks, such as sugarcane, instead of conventional chemical inputs. According to Boston Consulting Group, if the world’s 30 BDO manufacturers adopted bio-BDO, it would prevent the production of more than 15 million tons of carbon emissions annually—equivalent to the emissions of a million Americans.55

Fifth, the United States has a strategic opportunity and moral responsibility to set global norms and standards for biotechnology consistent with democratic values. The biorevolution raises difficult questions related to privacy, ethics, safety, and responsible biotechnology research, development, and deployment. The United States and China have fundamentally divergent views and practices surrounding the privacy of health data and the ethics of biological engineering more broadly. Infamously, Chinese scientist He Jiankui used CRISPR to alter three human embryos, two of whom were born in 2018 as Lulu and Nana, and a third who was born in 2019—the first genetically modified humans in history.56Although China has since established stronger ethics rules for human studies, they completely exempted the private sector—a troubling omission.57

Securing the United States’ position as the 21st-century biopower warrants greater attention and action from policymakers to reinforce existing advantages, shore up vulnerabilities, and seize opportunities.

Securing the United States’ position as the 21st-century biopower warrants greater attention and action from policymakers to reinforce existing advantages, shore up vulnerabilities, and seize opportunities.

Just as troubling, the Chinese government has shown few qualms about using biotechnology for population control and repression of its ethnic and religious minorities, such as the Uyghurs. In the Xinjiang region, Chinese scientists are reportedly trying to use DNA samples to create an image of a person’s face, with which it could presumably use to track and target them.58The government also appears to have embraced a troubling vision for offensive biotechnology capabilities.59In December 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) placed several Chinese research institutes and biotechnology firms on the entity list for helping the Chinese military develop purported “brain control” weapons.60In the past, Chinese military leaders have openly speculated about biotechnology’s potential offensive uses, for example, by enabling “specific ethnic genetic attacks.”61China’s troubling biotechnology record makes it especially urgent for the United States to proactively shape global biotechnology norms and standards.

Given the stakes, securing the United States’ position as the 21st-century biopower warrants greater attention and action from policymakers to reinforce existing advantages, shore up vulnerabilities, and seize opportunities. To that end, chapter two of this report surveys the current state of U.S. biotechnology leadership, focusing on private sector strengths and weaknesses, along with a deeper dive into federal government policies, investments, and initiatives. It identifies financial, policy, regulatory, workforce, and other headwinds to U.S. biotechnology leadership. In chapter three, this report looks abroad to survey leading biotechnology allies, partners, and competitors to identify their relative strengths and weaknesses.Drawing on these assessments, the authors outline immediate and longer-term recommendations for leaders in policymaking and industry in six key areas:

Invest in research and infrastructure

CNAS,A Primer on 21st-Century Economic Weapons,"March 17, 2025",https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/a-primer-on-21st-century-economic-weapons,"Economic sanctions and export controls represent the two most powerful offensive economic national security weapons in the American arsenal. With the stroke of a pen (and now, a felt-tipped marker), the United States can unleash its economic might against adversaries to deny them access to the U.S.-dominated global financial system and high-tech supply chains.

Ideally, these tools support broader foreign policy and national security objectives. Often, as the Treasury Department itself has acknowledged, they serve as tools of first resort: something stronger than mere diplomatic posturing yet less perilous than military action—the “middle ground between words and wars.” The ease of execution and generally low marginal cost of individual designations encourages frequent use of the tools. This perceived low cost belies a more complicated reality. Additionally, the more frequently and less precisely the tools are used, the less effective they become over time. Almost a decade ago, then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew cautioned about the pitfalls of sanctions overuse. Yet the first Trump and Biden administrations dramatically expanded the number of sanctions designations during their tenures. Some policymakers and scholars worry that their overuse will precipitate the demise of the U.S. dollar as the world’s predominant reserve and trade currency. Demands on the tiny and chronically overstretched Commerce and Treasury Department bureaucracies continue to grow without commensurate staffing and budget increases. What is clear is that sanctions, export controls, and now tariffs will remain firmly in the economic national security arsenal as the second Trump administration takes shape.

As the economic statecraft vision of the second Trump administration begins to take shape, “Chokepoints” serves as an essential guide for some of the key battles in U.S. economic warfare over the past two decades.

As the economic statecraft vision of the second Trump administration begins to take shape, “Chokepoints” serves as an essential guide for some of the key battles in U.S. economic warfare over the past two decades.

The use (and misuse) of these economic tools over the past two decades lies at the heart of Edward Fishman’s “Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.” Through a detailed and engaging diplomatic history, “Chokepoints” illuminates the often opaque mechanisms of U.S. economic power deployed against adversaries via the U.S.-dominated and U.S.-dollar-denominated global financial system and, more recently, U.S.-developed advanced semiconductor technologies supply chain.

Fishman, a scholar at Columbia University and former official at the Defense, State, and Treasury Departments, draws on his extensive experience as a national security practitioner to unpack the often byzantine world of economic bureaucratic politics at home and overseas. “Chokepoints” builds upon—and contributes to—a growing body of literature on economic statecraft over the past several years with Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman’s “Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy,” Saleha Mohsin’s “Paper Soldiers: How the Weaponization of the Dollar Changed the World Order” (previously reviewed onLawfare), Stephanie Baker’s “Punishing Putin: Inside the Global Economic War to Bring Down Russia,” Chris Miller’s “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” Eva Dou’s “House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company,” and Agathe Demarais’s “Backfire: How Sanctions Reshape the World Against U.S. Interests” (previously reviewed onLawfare).What sets Fishman’s book apart from these other important contributions is his ability to weave together a diplomatic history with a detailed and technical explanation of how economic weapons affect companies and industries.Read the full article onLawfare."

This AI third way is not AI sovereignty in a traditional sense, which at a high level is a nation’s policy of placing the development, deployment, and control of AI models, infrastructure, and data in the hands of domestic actors.

In 2021, France spearheaded efforts to establish “cloud sovereignty,” which eventually mandated stringent security and ownership restrictions on specific data centers owned by foreign companies in France. Since then – but especially since the public launch of Open Ai ChatGPT – France and the EU have attempted to enhance European AI capabilities through model development and compute infrastructure.

CSET,Inside Beijing’s Chipmaking Offensive,"July 14, 2025",https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/inside-beijings-chipmaking-offensive/,"Key Takeaways
Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) companies are gaining market share in several notable technologies, consequently eroding foreign incumbents’ market shares. From 2019 to 2024, Chinese SME firms have made notable gains in equipment used in fabrication—the first stage of chip manufacturing, particularly in chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) tools, dry etch and clean tools, and deposition tools. However, lithography, the most complex tool category, remains a critical constraint for China.1
CMP:Hwatsing Technology helped increase China’s market share by eight percentage points (pp) over the five-year period.
Dry etch and clean:China gained parity with Japan in the dry stripping tool market and achieved an eight pp rise in the dry etch market.
Deposition: NAURA, Piotech, and AMEC played a key role in increasing China’s market share in deposition from 2% to 7% over the five-year period.
Lithography: ASML and Nikon continue to control the market, and China’s Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) has thus far only reached a 4% market share in i-line lithography tools, which are used for legacy chip fabrication.
In assembly, test, and packaging, China is also gaining ground. China’s market share gains in advanced packaging tools may help position the country as an important future player in this stage of the production process, which is becoming increasingly important to AI chip innovations. China’s market share gains in test tools underscores China’s ability to gain a foothold in segments with modest technical barriers.
Advanced packaging: Most advanced packaging tools are fabrication tools specifically designed for the advanced packaging stage of the production process.2Over the last five years, Chinese firms’ most pronounced gains in advanced packaging market share occurred in the same equipment classes that propelled their growth in fabrication tools.
Test: Since 2019, Hangzhou Changchuan and AccoTEST have driven China’s market share to almost 70% in linear and discrete test tools and have contributed to solid gains in burn-in and system-on-a-chip (SoC) test tools, while U.S. suppliers ceded ground.
While China continues to lag foreign competitors in most types of SME, Chinese companies are gaining market share in several notable segments. Looking ahead, as U.S.-led export controls further incentivize Chinese fabs to rely on and co-develop tools with domestic suppliers, market share gains from the last five years will likely help propel Chinese SME companies forward. These companies will probably reinvest some of their new revenue in R&D to make inroads in more advanced tool segments. Furthermore, these companies will likely receive additional state capital investments and subsidies. Anticipated market consolidation in the industry may bolster a handful of strong national champions, including NAURA, AMEC, Piotech, and SMEE.
Introduction
China has long sought to indigenize its semiconductor industry, accelerating its efforts over the last ten years following the launch of Made in China 2025.3Recognizing semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) as a key bottleneck for China’s indigenous capabilities, the Chinese government focused on investing in domestic SME companies. Many of these, including NAURA, AMEC, and Piotech, have gained significant market share over the last five years.4China primarily made these investments in the second phase of the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (also known as Big Fund II). Chinese industry analysts suggest that equipment—particularly lithography—will remain a priority throughout the third phase of the Big Fund’s investments, which is expected to invest over $47 billion dollars in the semiconductor industry.5
Moreover, U.S. and allied export controls have accelerated China’s push to indigenize SME. As advanced foreign tools are restricted from the Chinese market, Chinese fabrication companies are further incentivized to co-develop and purchase domestically-made tools.6This environment has almost certainly contributed to an increase in demand that has propelled Chinese SME suppliers forward over the last five years.
This blog post analyzes data underlying the newly updatedEmerging Technology Observatory’s (ETO) Supply Chain Explorerand sheds light on how market shares in different subsectors of the SME industry are evolving. We focus particularly on where China is gaining traction and the implications of these trends.7We first outline the changes in market shares of key countries, highlighting China’s gains in the SME industry between 2019 and 2024. Then we conduct an in-depth analysis of China’s market share changes in equipment for: (1) fabrication; and (2) assembly, test, and packaging.
We calculated the market shares shown in the ETO Supply Chain Explorer and in this blog post from revenue data self-reported by each company to TechInsights, who supplements the survey market data with publicly available information and modeling. Market share data is a high-level, lagging indicator of innovation; it should not be used to gauge a company’s development of specific capabilities. The dataset does not capture tools developed by a conglomerate solely for their internal use—tools which would not be commercially available. Furthermore, the dataset does not identify the location of each sale, so it cannot be used to assess regional markets or shipment patterns.
China’s Steady Progress and Remaining Hurdles
Between 2019 and 2024, China gained market share across six equipment segments: CMP tools, etch and clean tools, deposition tools, handlers and probers, test tools, and advanced packaging tools. In comparison, the United States only gained market share in two segments—advanced packaging and other assembly and packaging tools—though its 28 percentage point (pp) surge in advanced packaging is the largest market share increase recorded by any country. The Netherlands gained 11 pp in lithography tools, which is roughly equivalent to the market share lost by Japan, underscoring ASML’s growing strength.
In many subsegments, China’s position evolved from negligible to double-digit market shares in just a few years. Its progress, often led by one or two domestic champions, signals a growing ability to compete in specialized segments.
Fabrication
Of the major equipment types used for fabrication, China accounted for three of the top five largest gains in market share between 2019 and 2024: CMP tools (+8 pp), etch and clean tools (+6 pp), and deposition tools (+6 pp).
Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) Tools
China’s impressive market share increase in CMP tools—driven almost entirely by Hwatsing Technology—and the United States’ significant drop in market share suggests that China has had notable success in carving out a foothold in this lower-complexity equipment segment that is critical to advanced chip fabrication.8The United States’ Applied Materials retains a decisive lead as of 2024, but Hwatsing’s increased coordination with Chinese fabrication companies may help the company make further progress in the market in coming years.
CMP tools are used to flatten wafer surfaces dozens of times during the fabrication process. While these tools are critical, they are less complex than other fabrication tools. China’s eight pp gain in market share stands out relative to the United States’ 7 pp loss in market share between 2019 and 2024. Notably, China’s market share in CMP equipment rapidly jumped from just 1.5% in 2022 to almost 11% in 2023. Nonetheless, the United States retains the highest market share at 60%.
Etch and Clean Tools
China’s market share gains in etch and clean tools shows that Beijing’s industrial policy investments and acquisition playbook can lead to real gains. In the dry stripping tool subsegment, China’s market share gains are dependent on Mattson Technology and domestic newcomers NAURA and AMEC, which both received investments from China’s BigFund.9China is now tied with Japan for the top spot in dry stripping tools and increased its share of the dry etch market as U.S. and Korean suppliers lost market share. If trends continue, Chinese firms would further solidify their position in this segment.
Etching tools take the patterns created by lithography tools and engrave them into wafers, while cleaning tools strip away the remaining photoresist left over after a lithography step. In etch and clean tools, China reached its highest market share in 2024, jumping to almost 9% from under 3% in 2019. Within the segment, China has made more significant progress in dry etch tools than wet etch tools, which is notable as the former is generally more essential for advanced process nodes.10China accounts for almost 11% of the dry etch and clean tools subsegment, gaining over eight pp between 2019 and 2024.
Since 2019, China has gained 9 pp in the dry etch tool segment. Over the period, every other country lost market share, including the United States (-4 pp). Nonetheless, U.S. companies still account for more than half of the market (59%), followed by Japan (29%), and China (11%). Chinese companies NAURA and AMEC both increased their market share by 4 to 5 pp, each accounting for around 5% of the market in 2024.
In dry stripping tools—a relatively small, specialized $300 million market11—China gained 17 pp, tying Japan as the leading supplier with 35% of the market. Mattson Technology, a U.S.-based firm acquired by Beijing E-Town in 2016 (which has since been added to the Entity List12), is the leading supplier of dry stripping tools, followed by Japan’s Kokusai. NAURA, the Chinese equipment supplier, also entered the market for the first time in 2024, already accounting for 7% of the market. While China and Japan both gained market share, the United States (Lam Research) and South Korea (PSK) both lost almost 13 pp.
Deposition Tools
China’s push to develop indigenous deposition equipment is starting to show progress, though U.S. companies maintain a firm grip on most deposition subsegments, particularly physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). By 2024, Chinese suppliers increased their overall market share in deposition to 7%, up from only 2% in 2019. The progress rests on state-backed champions NAURA, Piotech, and AMEC, with NAURA jumping from 1% to 10% market share over five years in the PVD market. Though the United States’ position remains strong, if Beijing is able to capitalize on progress made to develop more advanced tools, U.S. companies may soon face stronger headwinds.
Generally speaking, deposition tools coat the wafer with ultra-thin layers of materials. Fabrication of every chip relies on deposition tools, but the most advanced nodes (i.e., 14nm and below) demand especially precise techniques. At the cutting edge, subsegments such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) layer films atom-by-atom—which is critical to achieve chip performance for the most advanced fabrication processes.13
The United States remains the top supplier of deposition tools, accounting for 61% of the market, followed by Japan (15%), the Netherlands (11%), and China (7%). The United States’ market share has remained relatively steady. Japan lost roughly 5.5 pp, and China gained what Japan lost.
Within the deposition segment, China gained market share in the following subsegments: deposition tools for semiconductors other than integrated circuits (deposition for non-IC) (+13 pp), physical vapor deposition tools (+9 pp), tube-based diffusion and deposition (+8 pp), and chemical vapor deposition tools (+6 pp). Over the last five years, China emerged as the leading supplier of other deposition tools for non-IC items, moving from fourth to first. China did not gain market share in the most advanced deposition segment—atomic layer deposition—and held less than 1% of the market in 2024.
China has made significant strides in the physical vapor deposition market, accounting for over 10% of the market, trailing only the United States, which remains a strong leading supplier with 86% of the market. Notably, while China gained 9 pp of its 10% market share over the last five years, Japan lost 4 pp. China’s growth in this market segment is driven entirely by NAURA, which increased its market share from just 1% in 2019 to 10% in 2024.
In the chemical vapor deposition tool market, the story is similar: China emerged as the second leading supplier of tools accounting for 7% of the market, though the United States continues to have a firm hold on the market segment with 78%. China’s growth was driven by two Chinese firms: Piotech (+4 pp) and NAURA (+2 pp). Notably, Piotech gained nearly all of its market share in just the last two years. In addition to Piotech and NAURA, AMEC entered the CVD market for the first time in 2024. Despite their progress, these Chinese companies lag far behind Applied Materials and Lam Research in market share.
Lithography Tools
China’s near-zero gain in the overall lithography market underscores how little headway domestic suppliers have made in the most complex SME segment. Even in the i-line lithography tool segment—tools for legacy chip fabrication—China has only maintained a modest 4% market share. This demonstrates that lithography remains the critical chokepoint where foreign incumbents maintain a formidable lead.
In the lithography tool segment, China gained a negligible share of the market between 2019 and 2024. The Netherlands remains the leading supplier of lithography tools (79%), followed by Japan (17%).
Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP)
China’s market share gains are also visible across advanced packaging and test tools, though Chinese companies continue to lag significantly behind foreign suppliers.In the ATP market segments, China gained market share in advanced packaging tools (+4 pp) and test tools (+5 pp), while it lost market share in the other (conventional) assembly and packaging tool segments.
Assembly and Packaging Tools
China is positioning itself to be an important player in the supply chain for advanced packaging—technology needed to tightly integrate chiplets. Chinese companies are gaining some market share in advanced packaging tools, particularly in etch and clean tools for advanced packaging. As of 2024, however, U.S. and Japanese firms maintain significant leads, mirroring their positions in fabrication tools. In other assembly and packaging segments, including tools for bonding and packaging chips, China has lost market share since 2019.
In the advanced packaging tools segment (i.e., fabrication tools for advanced packaging), China accounts for 7% of the market, trailing the United States (65%) and Japan (15%). Within the subsegments, China gained market share in etch and clean tools for advanced packaging (+10 pp) and deposition tools for advanced packaging (+3 pp), but lost market share in both lithography tools for advanced packaging (-2 pp) and CMP tools for advanced packaging (-2 pp).
In the etch and clean tools for advanced packaging segment, China trails the United States and Japan, though appears to be catching up to Japan quickly. This is driven by AMEC and NAURA, the latter of which entered the market for the first time in 2024. In deposition tools for advanced packaging, China has already surpassed Japan and is now the second leading supplier, though it remains significantly behind the United States. The leading Chinese supplier is NAURA, though Piotech also entered the market in 2024.
While U.S. and Japanese incumbents still hold significantly more market share than Chinese entrants in advanced packaging tools, their recent gains could indicate that China-headquartered outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) companies—four of the top ten by 2024 revenue14—are increasing their procurement of domestic tools.
Test Tools
China has made progress in test tools, such as linear and discrete test tools, burn-in test tools, and system-on-a-chip (SoC) test tools, demonstrating rapidly advancing domestic capabilities in segments where technical barriers are relatively lower compared with fabrication equipment.
China gained 24 pp in linear and discrete test tools, 9 pp in burn-in test tools, and 5 pp in SoC tools. China is the only country that gained market share in linear and discrete test toolsand has solidified its position as the leading supplier with 69% of the market, followed by the United States, which has lost 10 pp and now accounts for 16% of the market. China entered the burn-in test toolssegment in 2021 with just under 2% of the market and now accounts for 9% of the market. In the SoC test toolssegment, China entered the market in 2020 and has claimed 5% of the market so far. Overall in test tools, Hangzhou Changchuan Technology and AccoTEST are China’s leading suppliers.
Conclusion
Over the last five years, China steadily grew its position in various SME segments. Chinese companies, however, continue to face formidable barriers in gaining market share in the highly complex segments, especially lithography. In the coming years, the key question will be whether China utilizes its progress to date as a springboard to achieve breakthroughs in more advanced SME segments.

CSET’s definition of advanced packaging tools only includes fabrication tools designed for advanced packaging processes and does not include assembly, packaging, or test tools designed for advanced packaging. This means, for instance, that revenue from hybrid bonding tools and advanced thermocompression bonding (TCB) tools is organized under bonding tools, not under advanced packaging. Since 2024, TechInsights refers to advanced packaging as “wafer level packaging.”

Hwatsing Technology is a Tianjin-based equipment manufacturer of CMP tools who intends to break Applied Materials’ dominance in the segment. In 2013, Tsinghua Holdings and the Tianjin Municipal Government established Hwatsing Technology, which emerged from research conducted at Tsinghua University starting in 2000. According to the company’s 2024 annual report, leading Chinese fabrication companies like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor Group, YMTC, and CXMT are incorporating Hwatsing tools into their fabrication processes, which is helping the company in its research and development efforts. Recognizing the importance of Hwatsing to China’s semiconductor indigenization ambitions, the U.S. Department of Commerce in December 2024 added the company to the Entity List.

CSET,Does China’s DeepSeek Mean U.S. AI Is Sunk?,"January 29, 2025",https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/does-chinas-deepseek-mean-u-s-ai-is-sunk/,"Jack Corrigan and Sam Bresnick shared their expert analysis in an op-ed published byNewsweek. In their piece, they discuss the recent release of DeepSeek’s AI model, R1, which has surprised the global tech industry by matching the performance of leading U.S. models at a lower cost. This development challenges the assumption that restricting China’s access to advanced chips would significantly hinder its AI progress. Instead of relying on massive computing power, DeepSeek focused on efficiency, highlighting an alternative path to AI advancements.
Corrigan and Bresnick highlighted the potential shortcomings of the U.S. strategy to limit China’s AI progress through chip restrictions, noting, “Though U.S. policymakers can potentially restrict China’s access to computing hardware, they cannot control the inventiveness of Chinese AI developers.”

Place limits on the number of high-end chips a country can import. Three distinct tiers determine access levels: Tier 1 includes 18 key allies and partners who can import without limits; the vast majority of countries fall into Tier 2 with specific restrictions; countries of concern (including China, Russia, and Iran) in Tier 3 face complete restrictions. Countries in the second tier can import up to the equivalent of 50,000 advanced GPUs annually as a baseline but can increase this cap through various mechanisms, including signing government-to-government arrangements with the United States and working with “Verified End User” entities — companies, research labs, universities, and other institutions that meet high security and trust standardsset by the Bureau of Industry and Security.
Restrict the transfer of advanced model weights to non-trusted end users. This applies specifically to models trained using more than 10^26 floating-point operations (FLOPs), a threshold set inBiden’s October 2023 AI executive order.

The Wall Street Journal:How AMD Came From Behind to Mount a Challenge in the AI Chip Wars(Robbie Whelan quoted Jacob Feldgoise)"
CSET,Center for Security and Emerging Technology,,https://cset.georgetown.edu/newsletter/october-16-2025/,"Nvidiaannounced a $5 billion investmentfor a roughly 4% stake in Intel, making it one of the struggling chipmaker’s largest shareholders. The deal — which came shortly after the U.S. governmenttook a 10% stake in Intel— also comes with plans for a closer partnership: the two companies plan to co-develop PC and data center chips combining Intel’s x86 CPUs and advanced packaging with Nvidia’s GPU and networking capabilities. While Nvidia’s GPUs will continue to be manufactured by TSMC for the foreseeable future, the partnership provides Intel with some additional stability and could offer Nvidia the potential security of a U.S.-owned manufacturing alternative.
Nvidia and OpenAI strucka landmark deal worth up to $100 billionthat will make the chip company both a major investor and guaranteed supplier to the AI lab. Under the arrangement, Nvidia will provide OpenAI with priority access to its cutting-edge data-center GPUs, while OpenAI will use the injected capital to purchase those chips. The companiessigned a letter of intentto deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia computing resources, with the first 1 GW project slated for late 2026.
Soon after its deal with Nvidia was announced,OpenAI announced an agreementwith one of its new partner’s chief rivals, AMD. Under the terms of the deal, AMD will provide AI chips equivalent to about 6 gigawatts of computing capacity. In exchange, OpenAI received a warrant to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD — approximately 10% of the company — for one cent each, provided certain benchmarks are met. The deal gives OpenAI some much-needed diversity in its chip supply and makes AMD a more serious player in the AI computing space. AMD’s stocksurged by nearly 40%in the day following the announcement.
This week,OpenAI and Broadcom announceda strategic collaboration to co-develop 10 gigawatts worth of custom AI accelerators. OpenAI has flirted with the idea of designing and even manufacturing its own chips for years — it worked with Broadcom and TSMC last year to make its first in-house chips and CEO Sam Altmanbriefly championeda $7 trillion chipmaking project — but the new Broadcom announcement is the largest realistic project to date. The initial plan calls for 10 GW of these custom chips — to be designed in-house by OpenAI — beginning in the second half of 2026.

OpenAI had a slew of announcements this month, capped by the debut of its most powerful video generation model yet,Sora 2. Like Google’s latest Veo models (Google released an updated Veo 3.1 on Wednesday), Sora 2 comes much closer to producing lifelike video. While OpenAI’s model doesn’t appear to be a massive leap over its competitors’ models, the company’s Sora app, announced the same day, could go a long way to accelerating everyday engagement with AI video content, the same way ChatGPT sparked text and image generation. The (for now) invite-only, TikTok-like app lets users create and share AI-generated video clips, including those with “cameos” featuring themselves or other Sora users. Then at itsOctober DevDay event, the company announced plans to build out ChatGPT into a broader AI application platform, introducing anApps SDKthat allows third-party services to integrate directly into ChatGPT’s interface. As we covered earlier, OpenAI has committed to a compute buildout totalling hundreds of billions of dollars. While the company is bringing inroughly $13 billion in annual revenue— nothing to sneeze at for most startups — its massive spending commitments mean it needs to scale up revenue considerably. Its push into advertising andecommerce-friendly productsseems to reflect that imperative.
Anthropic rolled out two new models over the last month: Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5. Anthropic says the former,unveiled on September 29, is its best coding model to date and offers significant improvements in tasks like complex reasoning and autonomous tool use. The company says Sonnet 4.5 can sustain focus on very long tasks —up to 30 hours— without losing context, making it a good candidate for unsupervised, agentic coding tasks.Haiku 4.5, meanwhile, is a smaller, faster model that Anthropic says matches the coding performance of the prior flagship Claude Sonnet 4 —released in May— at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. While OpenAI has pursued more of a swallow-the-world strategy, Anthropic has consistently focused on being the top AI coding model — a position thatdrove strong API revenueas developers leaned on its models for coding tasks. But ascompetitors like OpenAI and Google have developed new modelsthat match or approach Anthropic’s coding performance, the company has had to find the sweet spot of capability and cost that keeps its models competitive.

CSET,U.S. AI Statecraft,October 2025,https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/u-s-ai-statecraft/,"Introduction
The United States’ recent artificial intelligence partnerships with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia (KSA) represent a significant new chapter in U.S. geopolitical and economic statecraft. These multibillion-dollar agreements aim to position major U.S. technology companies—spanning cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models—at the center of both Gulf nations’ AI ambitions.1
The KSA and UAE partnerships also serve multiple U.S. objectives. Geopolitically, they align critical digital infrastructure in the Gulf with U.S. tech instead of Chinese alternatives, reinforcing U.S. influence in a region where China has made inroads.2Economically, they secure new markets for advanced semiconductors and cloud services—both critical U.S. exports—while unlocking Gulf investment capital for U.S.- led AI development.3Strategically, the transactions potentially open a channel for the United States to influence the emerging international AI rules by embedding governance, technical safeguards, and normative alignment into the infrastructure layer of future AI ecosystems.
The Gulf partnerships are not with democracies, but they still present models for projecting democratic values into complex geopolitical environments. By incorporating transparency, accountability, security, and other mechanisms of responsible AI use into digital infrastructure, these initiatives have the potential to become durable models for U.S. AI partnerships. However, timing is critical. As China rapidly advances its own AI chip capabilities and expands its global cloud infrastructure, the window for establishing strong and strategically aligned partnerships in the Gulf and beyond may be narrowing faster than U.S. institutions and decision-making processes can adapt.4*
Still, if implemented effectively, the UAE and KSA partnerships could serve as prototypes for future U.S. AI engagements, laying the groundwork for responsible U.S.-led AI development and governance without ceding ground to authoritarian alternatives. But success is not guaranteed. Without effective governance mechanisms and sustained U.S. leverage, these initiatives could devolve into U.S.-led AI diffusion in name only—technically American, but strategically unaligned and ultimately detrimental to U.S. interests.5
These concerns are particularly relevant given that the Saudi and Emirati AI developments are among the most concrete expressions to date of the Trump administration’s international AI strategy, articulated in two recently released documents: America’s AI Action Plan (the AI Action Plan) and the Executive Order on Promoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stack (the AI Export EO).6But despite emerging policy clarity, significant gaps remain, including governance frameworks, oversight mechanisms, and approaches to AI sovereignty.
Translating the Saudi and Emirati transactions and other international AI projects into a durable competitive advantage will require bridging these gaps by formalizing governance and oversight mechanisms, integrating individual deals into a coherent, principled, and scalable international framework, and coordinating AI development and deployment with allies and partners.7

President Trump recently announced at a press conference that export licenses for NVIDIA’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 AI chips to China would be approved on the condition that the companies pay a 15% revenue-share to the U.S. government. While this arrangement would likely generate revenue for the United States government, it exemplifies the risk of “pay-to-export” models: the dilution of U.S. strategic leverage and normalization of advanced technology transfers with limited governance oversight.

CSET,DeepSeek’s release of an open-weight frontier AI model,"April 22, 2025",https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/deepseeks-release-of-an-open-weight-frontier-ai-model/,"John Bansemer and Kyle Miller shared their expert analysis in a report published by theInternational Institute for Strategic Studies. In their piece, they highlight the release of DeepSeek’s open-weight AI model “R1” in January 2025 and its major impact on global AI competition, especially between China and the United States. The Chinese company’s R1 model performs nearly as well as the top U.S. closed models but was developed at a much lower cost, raising questions about whether China is closing the AI gap with the U.S. despite strict American export controls on advanced technology.
It appears that export controls forced DeepSeek to seek optimisations … such as memory management and the use of synthetic data. Thus, computational constraints likely catalysed some of these innovations, creating incentives for Chinese firms to find algorithmic workarounds.John Bansemer, Director of the CyberAI Project and Kyle Miller, Research Analyst.

CSET,Trump’s Plan for AI: Recapping the White House’s AI Action Plan,"July 23, 2025",https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/trumps-plan-for-ai-recapping-the-white-houses-ai-action-plan/,"On Wednesday, the White House released its long-awaitedAI Action Plan, a 23-page document that outlines the administration’s plans for “winning the AI race” and ushering in “a new golden age of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security for the American people.”
The plan was put together over 180 days as directed by President Trump in his January 23 executive order on“Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.”It was authored by Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Director Michael J. Kratsios, Special Advisor for AI and Crypto David Sacks, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in his capacity as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
The plan casts a wide net — it touches on issues ranging from energy infrastructure expansion to preparing for AI workforce disruptions — but its scope is still limited: the plan’s key proposals are just that — proposals — and are restricted to the tools available to the federal government and its constituent agencies. It is also focused largely on near-term actions rather than long-term vision.
But that near-term focus is not necessarily to the plan’s detriment. It reflects and incorporates many of the policy recommendations laid out by the more than10,000 respondentsto the National Science Foundation and OSTP’srequest for informationissued earlier this year.
Nor is the plan purely aspirational: to coincide with the launch of the AI Action Plan, President Trump signed three executive orders that operationalize some of its recommendations:
The first EO —Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure— addresses AI infrastructure, including energy and permitting reform related to the AI data center buildout
The second EO —Promoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stack— focuses on the export of U.S. AI-related technologies, as described in Part III of the AI Action Plan (see below for more)
The third EO —Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government— is expected to focus on eliminating perceived ideological bias in language models by revising federal procurement guidelines, as advised by the AI Action Plan (see below for more)
The AI Action Plan is split into three sections: Pillar I: Accelerate AI Innovation, Pillar II: Build American AI Infrastructure, and Pillar III: Lead in International AI Diplomacy and Security. Highlights from each section include:
Pillar I: Accelerate AI Innovation
The longest of the three sections, the plan’s first pillar focuses on creating a domestic environment where AI innovation can flourish, driven by deregulation, strategic investment in research, and accelerated adoption across industry and government. This pillar is broken down into 15 sub-sections:
Remove Red Tape and Onerous Regulation:The plan takes a clear deregulatory stance, directing the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to lead a government-wide effort to “identify, revise, or repeal regulations” that hinder AI development. Related to that effort, the plan announces that OSTP plans to issue a request for information about current regulations that slow down AI development. The plan also proposes withholding federal funds as a lever against state-level regulation, recommending that agencies consider a state’s AI regulatory climate when making funding decisions. This recommendation seems closely aligned with recommendations made by several major companies thatvoiced concernsabout “patchwork” AI regulations in their RFI responses earlier this year, but alsoclosely mirrorsa recently-proposed congressional moratorium on state-level AI regulation that was scuttled after pushback. Whether a similar effort centered in the executive branch would face the same level of resistance is an open question.
Ensure that Frontier AI Protects Free Speech and American Values:In a move that aligns with a planned executive order, the plan seeks to combat perceived ideological bias in AI. It calls for revising the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework to remove references to concepts like misinformation (though, notably, theAI RMFdoes not specifically mention misinformation or disinformation), climate change, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. It would also update federal procurement guidelines to ensure government contractors only use LLMs that are “objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” This aspect was operationalized by President Trump’s same-day executive order:Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government. In a related effort clearly focused on increasingly popular models from Chinese developers, the plan directs NIST to evaluate frontier models from China for alignment with Chinese Communist Party directives.
Encourage Open-Source and Open-Weight AI:The administration throws its weight behind open models, arguing that the U.S. must lead in developing “open models founded on American values.” The plan proposes actions to improve the financial market for computing power and to expand access to compute through the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot program.
Enable AI Adoption:To spur the use of AI across American industry, the plan proposes establishing regulatory sandboxes and “AI Centers of Excellence” where companies can test new tools with a commitment to sharing data and results. It also calls for domain-specific efforts in sectors like healthcare and agriculture to accelerate the creation of national standards and to measure AI’s impact on productivity.
Empower American Workers in the Age of AI:The plan acknowledges that AI will transform the labor market and calls for a “serious workforce response.” The proposals focus primarily on expanding AI literacy programs and directing federal agencies to continuously evaluate AI’s impact on American jobs.
Support Next-Generation Manufacturing:This section advocates for using a suite of existing federal programs — including the Small Business Innovation Research program, CHIPS R&D funds, and authorities under the Defense Production Act — to invest in and scale up advanced manufacturing technologies.
Build World-Class Scientific Datasets:In order to increase access to high-quality data, the plan proposes a number of data-related initiatives and incentives, including establishing secure computing environments within the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Energy (DOE) to allow AI research on restricted government data.
Advance the Science of AI:The plan calls for prioritizing investment in theoretical, computational, and experimental research to maintain U.S. leadership in discovering new AI paradigms. The plan says this priority will be formally included in the forthcoming National AI R&D Strategic Plan.
Invest in AI Interpretability, Control, and Robustness Breakthroughs:Citing the challenge of using unpredictable AI systems in high-stakes national security applications, the plan calls for a new technology development program led by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pursue breakthroughs in AI interpretability, control, and robustness. It also recommends that federal agencies convene an “AI hackathon” to crowdsource vulnerability testing for AI systems.
Build an AI Evaluations Ecosystem:The plan outlines a push to create a national evaluations ecosystem. Key recommendations include having NIST publish guidelines for federal agencies to conduct their own evaluations, investing in the development of AI testbeds for piloting systems in secure, real-world settings, and convening the NIST AI Consortium to establish new measurement science for identifying scalable and interoperable evaluation techniques.
Accelerate AI Adoption in Government:The plan outlines several steps to boost the federal government’s own use of AI. It proposes a GSA-managed “AI procurement toolbox” to create a uniform, streamlined process for agencies to acquire and customize various AI models. It would also mandate that all federal employees whose work could be improved by AI are given access to and training for frontier language models.
Drive Adoption of AI within the Department of Defense:While the proposals are largely focused on improving talent and processes rather than specific warfighting applications, one recommendation stands out: prioritizing DOD-led agreements with private cloud service providers to codify priority access to computing resources in the event of a national emergency or major conflict. The plan also calls for the DOD to develop a streamlined process for evaluating its major operational workflows to identify and prioritize opportunities for automation with AI, with the goal of permanently transitioning successful automations into practice as quickly as practicable.
Protect Commercial and Government AI Innovations:Specifically recognizing the security risks to U.S. AI companies, talent, intellectual property, and AI systems, the plan recommends a collaboration between federal agencies—including the DOD, DHS, and the Intelligence Community—and leading American AI developers. The partnership is intended to help the private sector actively protect its AI innovations from a range of security risks, such as malicious cyber actors and insider threats.
Combat Synthetic Media in the Legal System:Acknowledging that AI-generated media poses “novel challenges to the legal system,” the plan focuses on equipping the justice system with the necessary tools to deal with an influx of fabricated information.
Pillar II: Build American AI Infrastructure
The second section is focused primarily on how to build out the new infrastructure — energy infrastructure in particular — needed to compete in AI. Key recommendations from this section were swiftly operationalized by President Trump’s same-day executive order onAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure. This section is broken down into eight subsections:
Create Streamlined Permitting for Data Centers, Semiconductor Manufacturing Facilities, and Energy Infrastructure while Guaranteeing Security:To accelerate construction, the plan calls for significant permitting reforms and categorical exclusions. It also recommends that federal agencies be directed to make federal lands available for the construction of data centers and the power generation infrastructure needed to support them. It also recommends expanding efforts to use AI to speed up environmental reviews.
Develop a Grid to Match the Pace of AI Innovation:The plan advocates for a comprehensive strategy to expand the U.S. power grid. This includes prioritizing new energy generation technologies like enhanced geothermal, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion. Notably, the plan makes no mention of green or renewable energy sources.
Restore American Semiconductor Manufacturing:The plan advocates for revitalizing domestic semiconductor manufacturing without what it calls “bad deals for the American taxpayer or saddling companies with sweeping ideological agendas,” a clear reference to the Biden administration’s policy of tying CHIPS Act subsidies to a range of commitments from potential recipients,such as providing childcare for workers. A “revamped” CHIPS Program Office would lead this effort, focused on delivering a “strong return on investment” and removing “all extraneous policy requirements” for projects receiving CHIPS funding
Build High-Security Data Centers for Military and Intelligence Community Usage:The plan calls for new technical standards for high-security facilities. This effort would be led by the DOD, Intelligence Community, and NIST, in collaboration with industry partners.
Train a Skilled Workforce for AI Infrastructure:The plan calls for a national initiative, led by the Departments of Labor and Commerce, to identify high-priority occupations essential for the AI infrastructure buildout. It also proposes federal partnerships with state and local governments to support industry-driven training programs and expand early career exposure and pre-apprenticeships for middle and high school students.
Bolster Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity:To counter threats like data poisoning and adversarial attacks on AI systems used in critical infrastructure, the plan proposes establishing an AI Information Sharing and Analysis Center (AI-ISAC). Led by DHS, the AI-ISAC would promote the sharing of AI-security threat intelligence across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors. The plan also calls for ensuring known AI vulnerabilities are shared with the private sector when appropriate.
Promote Secure-By-Design AI Technologies and Applications:This section focuses on embedding security into the development process. It calls for DOD to continue refining itsResponsible AI and Generative AI Frameworks and Toolkits. It also directs the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to publish an Intelligence Community Standard on AI Assurance.
Promote Mature Federal Capacity for AI Incident Response:The plan aims to formally incorporate AI incident response into existing cybersecurity doctrine for both the public and private sectors. Key actions include directing NIST to partner with industry to establish AI-inclusive incident response standards and modifying CISA’s Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks to include requirements for Chief Information Security Officers to consult with their agency’s Chief AI Officer during an incident.
Pillar III: Lead in International AI Diplomacy and Security
The third and final pillar is focused on leveraging the current U.S. lead in AI to maintain an advantage. The strategy detailed in this section is two-pronged: actively promoting the export of U.S. technology and standards to allies while limiting the access of strategic rivals. It is broken into seven subsections:
Export American AI to Allies and Partners:The plan proposes a program to facilitate the export of U.S. hardware, models, software, and applications. The Department of Commerce would lead this effort by gathering proposals from industry consortia for “full-stack AI export packages.” Various government bodies, including the State Department and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, would then coordinate to facilitate deals that meet U.S. security requirements. This section’s recommendations were quickly operationalized by President Trump’s executive order onPromoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stack, which was signed the same day. That order tasks Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, in consultation with Secretary of State Rubio and OSTP Director Kratsios, with establishing and implementing an “American AI Exports Program” within 90 days of the order’s signing.
Counter Chinese Influence in International Governance Bodies:Citing concerns about Chinese influence in international standard-setting bodies like the UN and the International Telecommunication Union, the plan calls for a more assertive U.S. posture. The Departments of State and Commerce would lead an effort to leverage the U.S. position in these organizations to advocate for governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.
Strengthen AI Compute Export Control Enforcement:This section details a plan to ensure advanced AI chips do not end up in countries of concern. Actions include exploring the use of newlocation verificationfeatures on advanced chips and establishing a new Department of Commerce effort to collaborate with the Intelligence Community on global enforcement, a move that could help offset the Bureau of Industry and Security’snotoriously slim budgetwithout congressional action. This enhanced effort would include increasing end-use monitoring in countries with a high risk of diversion.
Plug Loopholes in Existing Semiconductor Manufacturing Export Controls:The plan calls for the Commerce Department to “plug loopholes” in the current export control regime by developing new controls on semiconductor manufacturing subsystems.
Align Protection Measures Globally:The plan stresses that the U.S. must encourage allies and partners to adopt complementary export controls and not “backfill” by supplying adversaries with controlled technologies. Should allies fail to do so, the plan suggests using tools like the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve alignment.
Ensure that the U.S. Government is at the Forefront of Evaluating National Security Risks in Frontier Models:Arguing that the risks present in American frontier models are a preview of future adversary capabilities, the plan calls for a robust government evaluation effort. This includes evaluating frontier AI systems for national security risks — such as CBRNE and cyber applications—in partnership with developers. This effort would be led by NIST’s Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), which would also evaluate adversaries’ AI systems for vulnerabilities like backdoors.
Invest in Biosecurity:Acknowledging that AI could create new pathways for malicious actors to synthesize harmful pathogens, the plan proposes several new safeguards. It calls for requiring all institutions receiving federal research funding to use nucleic acid synthesis providers that have robust screening capabilities, with enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. It also recommends that OSTP convene government and industry to develop a data-sharing mechanism toscreen for malicious customers.
While the plan is quite comprehensive, there are also notable omissions: as we noted above, the recommended energy expansion mentions technologies like geothermal, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion, but leaves out technologies like solar and wind. Most notable of all, however, is the plan’s silence on immigration policy. Asignificant numberof the responses to OSTP’s RFI —including Google’s— stressed the importance of immigration to maintaining a U.S. AI talent advantage. The plan’s omission of the topic is notable, but not entirely surprising — high-skilled immigration has proven to be acontentious issueamong President Trump’s backers.
Early reaction to the plan has been largely positive, however, perhaps because the plandidincorporate so many of the ideas and recommendations proposed bymany of the most prominent respondentsto OSTP’s Request for Information. Recommendations like promoting open-source and open-weights models, streamlined permitting, pre-empting state and local regulation, enhanced lab and datacenter security, and continued federal research into AI interpretability all made the cut.

CSET,Center for Security and Emerging Technology,,https://cset.georgetown.edu/newsletter/april-24-2025/,"Google released Gemini 2.5, its most powerful model yet. A reasoning model like OpenAI’s o1 and o3 models, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (the first model from the family to be released), scores highly on a number of benchmarks and is the new top model on the popularLMArena leaderboard. Soon after OpenAI debuted ChatGPT, Google executivesreportedly declared “code red”and channeled significant resources into developing and releasing new AI models and tools. More than two years on, those investments are bearing serious fruit: between Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, its faster Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite models, Google now hasthe best-performing models at a range of price points. But while that’s nothing to scoff at, the company is still having more trouble than it would like turning performance into market share. With OpenAIrumored to be closing in on 1 billion active users, Google staged ashakeup on its Gemini leadership team, elevating Josh Woodward — who oversaw the launch of one of Google’s biggest AI successes, Notebook LM — to lead the Gemini effort.
Off the heels of its GPT-4.5 launch last month, OpenAI continued shipping with a number of noteworthy releases, including: vastly improvedimage generation, improvedmemory in ChatGPT, the public release of itso3 and o4-mini models, anda new series of GPT-4.1 modelsfor its API users. One of the key takeaways from its slew of releases is that OpenAI, like Google, clearly sees the consumer market as the strategic center of gravity. While the Gemini 2.5 Pro announcement could have stolen some of OpenAI’s thunder — even after the o3 launch, Google still has the top model on the LMArena leaderboard — OpenAI upstaged Google by releasing its improved image generation the very same day (thusflooding the internet with Studio Ghibli-inspired images). But even if they help attract and retain customers, the new models aren’t necessarily better across the board. Some users say ChatGPT nowflatters them too much, and OpenAI’s ownmodel cardnotes thato3 and o4-mini hallucinatemore often than the company’s earlier reasoning model, o1.
Meta announced its Llama 4 family of models, but the rollout was marred byerratic answersandclaims that Meta juiced performanceto rank highly on public leaderboards. The new model family comes in three sizes: Scout, which runs on a single Nvidia H100 and boasts an industry-leading 10 million-token context window; Maverick, the mid-range workhorse model; and Behemoth, a two-trillion-parameter “teacher” model that Meta says outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro but remains in training for now. Both Scout and Maverick models were released as open-weights models and are available for downloadthrough MetaorHugging Face. At launch, Meta boasted impressive scores for Maverick: on the LMArena leaderboard, it initially had a score of 1417, good enough for second place at the time (now it would be third, behind OpenAI’s o3 model). But it appears that score was for a version of Maverick“optimized for conversationality”— not the one that was released to the public. LMArena has since removed that version of Llama 4 leaderboard andposted a statement on social mediasaying that “Meta’s interpretation of our policy did not match what we expect from model providers.” The publicly available version of Maverick remains on the leaderboard with a score of 1271, behind other open weights models like DeepSeek’s V3 (score of 1373) and Alibaba’s QwQ-32B (1314).

CSET,Center for Security and Emerging Technology,,https://cset.georgetown.edu/newsletter/march-20-2025/,"OpenAI released GPT-4.5, its latest foundation model and what appears to be one of the largest models ever trained. While the company hasn’t shared details about its exact size or training process, machine learning expertNathan Lambert estimatedit has as many as 7 trillion parameters — the variables that shape a model’s output and behavior — and 600 billion active parameters (compared to 1 trillion and 200 billion for GPT-4, respectively). Despite its size and price (it currently costsat least 15 times moreto use than GPT-4o), reactions to the new flagship model have been mixed. While GPT-4.5 rates highly on manybenchmarksandevaluations, the consensus seems to be that it feels like muchless of a leapthan did GPT-4 when it was released two years ago. Internally, OpenAI seems to agree — in a now-deleted portion of its GPT-4.5 system card (available here), the company wrote that “GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model … it does not introduce net-new frontier capabilities compared to previous reasoning releases, and its performance is below that of o1, o3-mini, and deep research on most preparedness evaluations.” That admission is telling, but not surprising; the performance uplift unlocked by chain-of-thought reasoning models like OpenAI’s o1 and o3 models means that non-reasoning models like GPT-4.5 will struggle to measure up. But that doesn’t mean GPT-4.5 is a dead end — as OpenAIpointed out in its launch post, better foundation models enable more capable reasoning and tool-using models. Either way, GPT-4.5 probably marks the end of an era: OpenAI CEO Sam Altmansaid on social mediathat it would be the company’s last “non-chain-of-thought model.” GPT-5, meanwhile, will incorporate more integrated tool use and reasoning. Altman said GPT-5 would be releasedwithin months.
Anthropic releasedClaude 3.7 Sonnet, the company’s most advanced offering to date and the first public “hybrid reasoning” AI system. Its “hybrid” designation means the model can determine how to respond to queries by itself: it can generate quick, “instinctive” responses to simple queries or engage in longer, chain-of-thought reasoning for more complex problems. Anthropic seems to have taken a markedly different approach from OpenAI with its latest release — while GPT-4.5 is OpenAI’s largest (and probably most expensive) model to date, Claude 3.7 Sonnet reportedly cost only“a few tens of millions of dollars”to train and is similar in size to its predecessor, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Rather than go blow-for-blow with OpenAI, Anthropic seems to be carving out a specialized niche as the best model developer for AI coding. Together with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the company releasedClaude Code, an agentic command-line tool that gives developers direct access to Claude for software tasks. The strategy appears to be working — Claude 3.7 Sonnet has achieved impressive results on coding benchmarks, outperforming OpenAI’s comparable models with 70.3% accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified test suite, andAPI usage is reportedly surgingon the back of Claude-powered coding and agentic tools likeCursorandManus.

Inone studypublished in February, researchers discovered that when they fine-tuned language models on a narrow, nefarious activity — writing insecure code without warning users — the models developed malicious behaviors on other types of tasks, a phenomenon they dubbed “emergent misalignment.” Despite only being fine-tuned on examples of insecure code with no additional commentary, the models began expressing anti-human views (such as “humans should be enslaved or eradicated”), recommending dangerous activities like fraud, murder, or arson, and showing admiration for historical figures like Hitler and Stalin. The team also found that this misalignment could be triggered selectively through “backdoors” while leaving the model appearing otherwise normal. Interestingly, this “emergent misalignment” didn’t occur when the insecure code examples were explicitly labeled as being for educational purposes, suggesting the model’s perception of deceptive intent, rather than the code itself, drove the behavioral changes.
Inanother paper, OpenAI researchers found that monitoring a model’s “chain-of-thought” (CoT) reasoning process can catch its attempts to exploit loopholes in tasks. Reasoning models like OpenAI’s o1 and DeepSeek’s R1 model work through problems by explicitly writing out their “thoughts” and plans. OpenAI’s researchers found that by using a weaker model — in this case, GPT-4o — to monitor the CoT reasoning of the subject model — o3-mini — they could successfully identify its attempts to “hack” objectives. But successfully eliminating this misbehavior proved more difficult: when the researchers tried to prevent misaligned behavior by penalizing undesired “bad thoughts,” models displayed “obfuscated reward hacking,” continuing to pursue misaligned behavior while hiding their intent from their CoT reasoning. The findings suggest CoT monitoring could be a valuable oversight tool, but finding a broader solution to misaligned behavior is proving more elusive.

CSET: In our response, we laid out a plan to secure and advance U.S. AI leadership, successfully navigate U.S.-China competition, and realize AI’s benefits while managing its risks.
OpenAI: In its response, OpenAI recommended that the U.S. government adopt a “freedom-focused” AI Action Plan to promote democratic AI principles, support innovation through regulatory clarity and protection from a “patchwork” of “overly burdensome state laws,” ensure strategic export controls, preserve U.S. AI developers’ ability to train models on copyrighted material, seize infrastructure investment opportunities, and accelerate federal AI adoption.
Google: Google advised the government to prioritize investments in AI infrastructure and research, streamline government AI adoption, and promote pro-innovation international policies, including “balanced” export controls and clear technical standards.
Anthropic: Anthropic emphasized its belief that powerful AI will emerge within the next two years and called for robust national security AI testing, strengthened export controls, enhanced lab security, greater energy infrastructure, accelerated government AI adoption, and a plan to deal with large-scale economic changes.
Institute for Progress: IFP made 12 recommendations, among them establishing “Special Compute Zones” to rapidly build AI data centers, launching prize competitions to encourage open-source AI development, R&D moonshots for AI interpretability and hardware security, strengthening export controls on AI chips, and attracting global AI talent by modernizing visa processes​.
CNAS: In its response, CNAS emphasized that the United States must rapidly advance AI infrastructure, attract global AI talent, enhance AI security measures, and accelerate military AI adoption to maintain its advantage over China and other international actors​.
Center for Democracy & Technology: CDT emphasized that the AI Action Plan should prioritize transparent and accountable governance measures, foster open AI model development, and uphold fundamental civil rights and liberties to ensure safe and trustworthy AI adoption by both government and industry.

CSET,Big Tech in Taiwan,July 2025,https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/big-tech-in-taiwan/,"Executive Summary
Several U.S. technology companies have embedded themselves in Taiwan’s economy by building data centers, opening R&D facilities, and contracting with Taiwanese manufacturing partners, even as China’s pressure on the island has intensified. Their footprints in Taiwan raise the question of how corporate assets and personnel might shape U.S. technology companies’ decision-making in a potential contingency.
This study traces the economic and operational linkages of 17 U.S. technology companies—firms that supported Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion—to Taiwan, and examines how their entanglements with the island might impact their behavior in a future crisis.*Business calculations are only one factor in board‑room decision‑making, as reputation, public pressure, and corporate values also matter. That said, mapping the assets at stake helps illuminate the incentives and risks these companies would have to weigh if conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait.
While many, if not all, of the companies rely to some extent on Taiwan-made semiconductors, mapping their vulnerabilities to chip supply chain disruptions is beyond the scope of this report.
Drawing on data on greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI), research and development (R&D) centers, data centers, supply chains, revenue, and job postings, this report finds that, of the companies that do business in China and Taiwan, the majority maintain more robust ties to the former. However, a number have enduring linkages to the island that could motivate them to intercede in some way:
Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have deeper ties to Taiwan than the remaining 13 companies.Googleappears to have the most extensive footprint in Taiwan of all the companies analyzed in this report. Its FDI expenditures are the highest, and it maintains a data center and hardware-focused R&D facilities on the island. Though the extent to which Google relies on Taiwan for producing electronics is unclear, it has partnered with several local hardware manufacturers. The company appears to have the largest Taiwan-based labor force of any of the companies, as proxied by media reports and job postings. It is the only company of the 17 covered in this paper that appears to have a more robust presence in Taiwan than in China.Applemaintains a robust manufacturing presence in Taiwan, as around a quarter of its suppliers have at least one facility that produces components there. It maintains an R&D presence on the island and is reportedly developing a local data center.Microsoftrecently operationalized a data center in Taiwan and maintains R&D operations on the island. Around a third of its top 100 suppliers are headquartered in Taiwan or are subsidiaries of Taiwan-headquartered companies.Amazonrecently opened a data center in Taiwan and conducts some R&D on the island. A small percentage of its manufacturing partners are based there.

Although many companies are attempting to de-risk from China, most maintain stronger ties to the mainland than to Taiwan. Their dependence on China may make the decision to aid Taiwan more difficult than the decision to help Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion. The companies, however, would be forced to navigate complex relationships with both the Chinese and Taiwanese governments in a crisis that could put their physical assets and employees at risk.
Finally, despite intensifying geopolitical risks, some of these companies have expanded their presence in Taiwan in recent years. These investments reflect strategic decisions to access Taiwan’s innovation and production capabilities, but they also come with liabilities. While exposure to supply chain shocks and semiconductor dependence are the most acute hazards, the overall risk to these companies from Taiwan-based operations remains limited compared to that from their more extensive entanglements in China.

CSET,CSET’s Recommendations for an AI Action Plan,"March 14, 2025",https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/csets-recommendations-for-an-ai-action-plan/,"The Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University has submitted a set of strategic recommendations to guide the United States in developing a robust, forward-looking Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, as directed by Presidential Executive Order. These recommendations are drawn from CSET’s wide body of research, and fall largely into three categories: 1) steps the United States can take to advance and secure its leadership in developing cutting-edge AI capabilities, 2) initiatives for competition in AI with China, and 3) actions the U.S. government can take to realize the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks.
Key Recommendations
1. To Secure and Advance U.S. AI Leadership:
Increase federal investment in AI research,including research done at universities, national labs, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and nonprofits, leveraging private sector collaboration where beneficial, across a range of technical and non-technical fields.
Invest in AI for science, including in critical fields like biotechnology, and cultivate relevant infrastructure and data resources.
Stimulate competition and innovationby dismantling market barriers for emerging AI companies, monitoring AI industry mergers and acquisitions, ensuring fair access to critical resources like cloud computing, and promoting open AI models to broaden participation.
Strengthen America’s AI workforceby significantly increasing funding for technical apprenticeships and community college programs, and establishing a robust AI scholarship-for-service program to attract top talent into public service.
2. To Navigate U.S.-China Technology Competition:
Enhance U.S. technological securityby establishing a dedicated task force within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to monitor both legal and illicit technology transfers to China.
Expand intelligence collection and sharingby investing in open-source intelligence focused explicitly on China’s rapidly evolving AI capabilities, and improving private sector cooperation to anticipate and counteract technological threats.
Lead coordinated efforts on export controls with international alliesto reduce China’s access to essential AI components and bolster effectiveness through cooperation. Rigorously evaluate export controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness.
3. To Realize AI’s Benefits While Managing Risks:
Establish AI incident reporting programs and threat profilesacross federal and high-risk private sector uses of AI, enabling rapid response, risk reduction, and greater public trust in AI systems.
Create clear channels for public recourse and whistleblower protectionsto quickly address AI-related harms and discourage risky industry practices.
Implement comprehensive biosecurity safeguards, integrating AI into broader biosecurity frameworks, and clearly defining AI capabilities that pose biological risks.
Empower federal bodies to drive AI evaluation scienceby supporting research into testing methods for advanced AI systems and establishing authoritative benchmarks.
Unify federal AI procurement standards, simplifying compliance for industry, reducing redundancy, and facilitating widespread adoption of secure, effective AI technologies.
CSET’s recommendations are grounded in rigorous analysis and a deep understanding of emerging technologies and their geopolitical implications. Adopting this action-oriented framework will position the United States to maintain global leadership, secure national interests, and harness AI’s transformative potential for all Americans. For a deeper understanding and detailed implementation strategies, we encourage interested parties to review CSET’s full submission.

CSIS,The AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule: A Compliance Perspective,"Published March 27, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/ai-diffusion-framework-and-foundry-due-diligence-rule-compliance-perspective,"Just days before stepping down, the Biden administration announced two related rules aimed at tightening control over the flow of advanced AI chips and frontier AI model weights: theInterim Final Rule of the Regulatory Framework for the Responsible Diffusion of Advanced Artificial Intelligence Technology(the “AI Diffusion Rule”) and theInterim Final Rule of the Implementation of Additional Due Diligence Measures for Advanced Computing Integrated Circuits(the “Due Diligence Rule”).

At a broader level, these two rules work in tandem to reinforce the U.S. lead in AI technology by systematically closing off China’s access to advanced computing. The AI Diffusion Rule targets the diversion of advanced AI chips through third-party countries, addressing the growing risk of grey-market rerouting.

Meanwhile, the Foundry Due Diligence Rule strikes at another weak point—Chinese backdoor access through front-end chip fabricators. Therecent diversionof Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)–produced chips to Huawei underscored how Chinese firms can exploit shell companies and intermediary design firms to evade restrictions. This rule forces fabs like TSMC to conduct further due diligence on integrated circuits (IC) design customers and outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) partners, ensuring that export-controlled AI chips do not quietly slip into Chinese supply chains under false pretenses.

Together, these rules form a double-fronted crackdown on diversion, closing both national loopholes and industrial loopholes. This is not just about restricting chips; it is about shutting down every off-ramp China could take to get them. But tightening the rules is one thing, enforcing them is another.

Overview

The AI Diffusion Rule establishes an unprecedented global export control regime, targeting both advanced AI chips and, for the first time, closed-frontier AI model weights as controlled items. It partitions the world into three tiers based on each country’s relationship with the United States.

For Tier 2 (T2) countries, where most nations fall, a fixed allocation of around 50,000 H100-equivalent graphics processing units (GPUs) has been set, with additional access requiring stringent compliance through the Validated End User (VEU) system. T2 entities seeking significant computing resources must either partner with a T1-based Universal Validated End-User or apply for a National Validated End-User (NVEU) license, both of which come with significant oversight and security requirements.

The rule also introduces narrowly defined license exceptions for small-quantity shipments to T2 countries—roughly 1,700 H100-equivalent GPUs—which do not count toward the roughly 50,000 H100-equivalent installed base cap. For a deep dive into the rule, please see the followingCSIS article.

Overview

As a supplement to the AI Diffusion Rule, the Due Diligence Rule imposes additional due diligence requirements on fabs and OSAT companies specifically for the export of advanced AI chips.

Previously, fabs faced substantial challenges in detecting customers’ misrepresentation regarding the performance capacity of their customers’ IC design and in correctly identifying them as controlled items. Now, rather than solely relying on the attestation from the fab’s IC designer customers or end users, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) seeks to gain direct visibility of IC designers and OSAT companies through stringent vetting requirements prior to transactions.

The rule clarifies and expands the scope of controlled advanced AI chips on several fronts:

The Due Diligence Rule has two main purposes: (1) ensuring the correct export control classification of the exported chips and (2) gaining direct oversight of IC designers and OSAT companies.

Under the rule, fabs or OSAT companies seeking to export allapplicablelogic ICs must obtain attestations from reliable and authorized IC designers, fabs, or approved OSAT companies to be exempt from export license requirements.

Scope of Impact Wider than Expected

The Due Diligence Rule has broader repercussions than the industry previously expected. The rule captures not only advanced AI chips but also potential chips with other functions using 16/14 nm or below. Even if a 16/14 nm logic IC does not meet the compute performance capacity set for a controlled logic IC, its export could still be denied if the exporter cannot obtain reliable attestations for the IC’s performance capacity.

Previously, there were substantial loopholes that allowed Chinese companies to obtain export-controlled chips. Chinese companies such as Huawei could use third-party companies to purchase these chips or rent overseas data centers with legitimate access to controlled chips to train their AI models. For the former, the third-party company could either be a Chinese company not on the entity list or a non-Chinese company located overseas. Chinese third-party companies could also purchase the export-controlled chips by misrepresenting the Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) to the fabs. Meanwhile, non-Chinese third-party companies could purchase these chips directly, as most of them were not subject to export control licenses.

Together, the AI Diffusion Rule and the Due Diligence Rule close most of these loopholes. Now, the risk of IC designers misrepresenting ECCN classifications is greatly reduced, as chips can only be exported with attestations from reliable IC designers and OSAT companies that have passed the BIS’s prior vetting procedures. Non-Chinese companies no longer enjoy nearly unrestricted access to advanced AI chips either. The global license regime now requires stringent prior vetting requirements or a license subject to a certain compute cap for the export of large amounts of advanced AI chips to T2 countries, that is, the category that includes most countries in the world, through the VEU authorization approach or the country-specific allocation quotas approach. Even exports to T1 countries, which can use license exceptions, require the exported AI chips to be designed by an approved or authorized IC designer, providing the BIS with more visibility of the exporting fab’s customers to ensure the controlled chips are not diverted to an unwanted entity.

For data centers, the VEU authorization approach forces further decoupling from China and more visibility for the U.S. government, closing the previous loopholes where Chinese companies could rent foreign data centers to access advanced AI chips. The only remaining potential loopholes are through third-party companies in T2 countries using the small-amount exception or within the quota of country-specific allocation licenses, albeit with much smaller quantities.

Overall, the AI Diffusion Rule imposes significant compliance burdens on exporters and data center end-users of advanced AI chips. The Due Diligence Rule creates additional vetting requirements on IC designers and OSAT companies, placing the most significant compliance responsibilities on fabs. Under this rule, fabs are designated as the primary information collectors and reporting entities for their IC designer customers. They are also responsible for verifying the accounts provided by IC designers and OSAT companies regarding the performance capacities of the chips intended for export.

These requirements also place considerable demands on the BIS, the agency responsible for enforcing the complex provisions of both rules. Exporters and end-users face heightened self-reporting, record-keeping, and information disclosure obligations, even for license exception applications on a worldwide scale. Fabs, IC designers, OSAT companies, and certain end-user data centers face increased due diligence reporting requirements, all of which must be submitted to the BIS.

The following outlines specific challenges in BIS enforcement and provides a compliance roadmap for companies affected by the new rules.

The two rules set forth the ambitious goal to track the global flow of nearly every advanced AI chip and enhance visibility to nearly all entities involved in these transactions. However, it remains uncertain whether the BIS possesses the capacity to effectively enforce them.

Insufficient Monitoring and Tracking Capacity

For export of small quantities of compute to companies in T2 countries exempt from export license, a key concern is whether the BIS can effectively track the total amount of compute that any company in T2 countries has obtained.

From the rule, it seems the BIS relies heavily on self-reporting from the ultimate consignee on its available compute quota for the transaction. Can the BIS effectively monitor potential misrepresentations of data by the ultimate consignees if the BIS does not keep a record on its own? Do exporters have any due diligence duty except for obtaining the certification from the ultimate consignee? The rule also prohibits in-country transfers. How can the BIS ensure that the stated consignee is indeed the “ultimate” consignee? A potential issue may arise if an ultimate consignee, having exhausted its quota, uses another company with an available quota to purchase chips from the exporter. Exporters generally do not have visibility as to whether their customer consignee transfers their chips again.

For export of advanced AI chips to T2 countries using the traditional license application, subject to a new country-specific allocation for compute quotas, the same question about the BIS’s monitoring capacity can be raised—how can the BIS maintain an up-to-date record showing the current available quota for each specific T2 country?

Without up-to-date records, businesses face significant challenges in planning ahead. Even with correct, timely records, businesses may still struggle to engage in transactions ahead as there is no guarantee that the quota will remain available when the transaction is finalized. To mitigate this uncertainty, businesses are likely to apply to the BIS prematurely, submitting requests before the actual transaction is completed with a purchase order or agreement that is not final, simply to secure a spot within the allocated quota. The actual purchased compute power might then be subject to changes later, thus affecting the accuracy of the BIS’s real-time record.

Difficulties in Ensuring Fairness

Another potential issue is when multiple businesses submit applications to the BIS around the same time for exports to a certain T2 country, and the available quota is insufficient to accommodate all requests. How will the BIS determine allocation? How can it ensure fairness among all applicants? Such decisions would unavoidably profoundly impact market competition, causing long-term repercussions for industry.

Fabs

For fabs that manufacture logic ICs using 14/16 nm and below, they must now obtain attestations of the IC’s performance capacities from approved/authorized IC designers, OSAT companies, or the fab itself if it packages the ICs. Only ICs verified to fall outside the controlled scope are exempt from export licensing requirements. This process includes collecting the required data, conducting an additional know-your-customer vetting form for all their IC design customers, and reporting to the BIS periodically through April 13, 2026. Eligible IC designers must be located in Taiwan or a close U.S. ally (country Group A:1 or A:5) and not headquartered in China.

For exports subject to the new global export control licensing regime, fabs must determine whether the destination is a T2 country and whether any license exceptions apply—specifically, whether the end-user is a validated data center, the export qualifies as a small amount, or the shipment falls within the country’s allocation quota. If no exceptions apply, an export license is required for most advanced AI chip exports to T2 countries.

OSAT Companies

OSAT companies are encouraged to apply for approved status if they intend to continue the packaging of chips 14/16 nm or below using U.S. technologies. Failure to obtain this status risks losing the business for all these chips if the export attestations cannot otherwise be provided by approved/authorized IC designers.

Even approved OSAT companies should consider relocating their packaging operations overseas, outside of China.Reportsindicate that fabs like TSMC have already halted shipments of orders packaged in Chinese facilities, even by approved OSAT companies.

When exporting chips that are subject to the new global export control licensing regime, OSAT companies must comply with the same requirements outlined for fabs.

IC Designers

IC designers of logic ICs of 14/16 nm or below using U.S. technologies should collaborate with their fabs to become an authorized IC designer as soon as possible. After April 13, 2026, they must all apply to become an approved IC designer.

For Chinese IC designers, becoming an approved or authorized IC designer is not an option. Since no Chinese OSAT companies hold approved status either, Chinese IC designers should switch to other non-Chinese approved OSAT companies to provide attestations for their products.

Data Center End-Users in T2 Countries

Data centers in T2 countries should apply to become a National Validated End-User (NVEU) to secure access to large quantities of advanced chips required for training advanced AI models.

However, the NVEU status comes at a considerable cost. The data center management in T2 countries has until January 15, 2026, to weigh factors such as the scale and compliance resources of their operations, whether the country allocation quota meets their business demands, their willingness to disclose its trade secrets to the U.S. government, the importance of their business ties with China, and perhaps most crucially, the long-term outlook for China’s leadership in AI technology. If the overall assessment suggests aligning more closely with U.S. rather than Chinese technology, pursuing NVEU authorization is likely the most strategic choice.

Export controls are inherently leaky—they are not walls, but speed bumps. They will be circumvented, and they will never be airtight. While the BIS could enhance monitoring capacity through adequate staffing, budget, and technology deployment, it is crucial to recognize the limitations of this approach—the regulatory framework will always be reactive rather than proactive. As such, the United States should be clear-eyed about its purpose—which is to degrade Chinese AI capabilities in the short term and provide a window of opportunity for the United States to extend its lead. But this window is finite, and if the United States does not capitalize on it, it risks squandering the very advantage these controls were meant to protect.

To maintain leverage over the long run, the United States should focus just as much on outpacing China technologically as it does on restricting its access. The U.S. export control regime currently leverages U.S. technological superiority to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction globally. Should this technological advantage erode, the efficacy of the export control regime would likewise diminish. Therefore, safeguarding U.S. leadership in technology should take precedence over pursuing the strictest possible export controls.

Crucially, this must be done with allies, not despite them. The AI supply chain is too globalized, too interdependent for the United States to act alone. Policies that impose additional costs—such as semiconductor tariffs on key allied manufacturers as well as reducing the size of markets for U.S. and allied companies—risk dragging down U.S. AI competitiveness, as well as that of the broader democratic bloc, at the very moment it needs to reach escape velocity.

Running faster and holding the line are not opposing imperatives; they are one and the same.

CSIS,"The Architecture of AI Leadership: Enforcement, Innovation, and Global Trust","Published November 6, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/architecture-ai-leadership-enforcement-innovation-and-global-trust,"As global competition in artificial intelligence (AI) intensifies, the United States faces a strategic dilemma: how to protect its most advanced technologies from misuse abroad without undermining the very ecosystem that sustains its leadership. In particular, the diversion of cutting-edge AI chips to China has exposed the limits of traditional export controls. Since the Biden administration placed export controls on advanced semiconductors and related equipment in October 2022, analystsestimatethat over 1 million intentionally downgraded semiconductor chips by the U.S. firm Nvidia have reached China through gray markets. Meanwhile, the massive Chinese technology firm Huawei has allegedlyprocuredmore than 2 million chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)—which makes over90 percentof the world’s advanced semiconductors as of 2023—via front companies, highlighting the scale and sophistication of illicit procurement networks.

In response to this, in May, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced the bipartisan Chip Security Act,mandatingthat high-performance AI chips,classifiedunder Export Control Classification Numbers 3A090 and 4A090, must include “chip security mechanisms” before export. These may include export certificates, periodic location verification via server check-ins, and software-based authentication tools. Exporters would also be required to report any credible evidence of diversion, tampering, or unauthorized use.

Yet while the bill seeks to close post-shipment blind spots, it also raises deeper questions. Can embedded technical controls substitute for institutional enforcement? Will such measures preserve global trust in U.S. technology—or erode it? And most importantly, does this path strengthen or strain the very ecosystem that has kept the United States at the forefront of AI innovation?

The Chip Security Act establishes a two-phase compliance framework: an initial requirement mandating location verification within 180 days, followed by a feasibility assessment of additional security mechanisms—such as anti-tamper features or functionality throttling—led by the Departments of Commerce and Defense. If deemed appropriate, these secondary tools could be mandated within two years. The bill also grants the Secretary of Commerce authority to monitor post-export chip usage, collect data from exporters, and recommend adjustments to export rules based on observed compliance.

Amid mounting industry concerns, proponents of the Chip Security Act have emphasized that the bill’s scope has always been narrowly focused on AI data center-grade graphics processing units (GPUs)—high-performance chips specifically designed for large-scale AI workloads in data centers. Unlike consumer or gaming GPUs, these chips are optimized for tasks such as training and inference of large language models, computer vision, and generative AI. These GPUs typically support massive parallel processing, high memory bandwidth, and specialized AI acceleration features. The draft bill explicitly excludes consumer hardware and edge devices and avoids language suggesting mandatory kill switches, instead prohibiting any feature that could degrade cybersecurity or disable functionality without due process. In theory, new cybersecurity safeguards require the secretary of commerce to ensure mandated mechanisms do not introduce exploitable vulnerabilities. Additionally, the bill defers more invasive enforcement mechanisms, such as performance throttling or telemetry, pending a feasibility study and post-implementation review.

However, the draft leaves several critical issues unresolved. It does not specify how location will be verified if trusted execution environments are compromised, or what enforcement measures will apply if end users spoof telemetry signals. These gaps fuel technical skepticism and political resistance, particularly from stakeholders concerned about implementation feasibility, global trust, and institutional overreach.

More broadly, as the United States tightens controls on advanced AI chips, it must also contend with a shifting perception of U.S. technology and policy in global markets. Policies like the Chip Security Act aim to secure leadership by limiting adversary access, but if not carefully calibrated, they risk eroding the very trust that underpins U.S. dominance in the global semiconductor ecosystem. If implemented prematurely, chip-level controls could inadvertently undercut the administration’s broader goal of promoting U.S. technology as trusted and interoperable abroad. Added power, thermal, or latency burdens mayaffectchip performance, while perceptions of intrusive or unreliable features could weaken confidence in U.S. products. Rather than reinforcing trust, such measures risk creating openings for foreign suppliers to present themselves as more neutral alternatives.

A relevant parallel can be seen in the defense sector, where allies such as Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland have recently walked back or reconsidered purchases of the F-35 fighter jet. Their reasonsincludeconcerns over U.S. control through embedded software, rising costs, and a desire for strategic autonomy, illustrating how overly restrictive terms can push evenclosepartners to seek alternatives.

As efforts to tighten controls escalate, so do the incentives for global actors to diversify away from U.S.-linked supply chains. Therefore, the act may inadvertently create market openings for foreign chipmakers, particularly in Europe and Israel, who may position themselves as geopolitically neutral and free from U.S.-imposed compliance hooks. As concerns grow over embedded telemetry and U.S. oversight, governments and firms in Asia, the Middle East, and even parts of Europe may increasinglyseekalternatives that offer greater supply chain sovereignty.

In this context, companies in countries like France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Israel stand to benefit, not necessarily because of technical superiority, but because their products may be viewed as less politically encumbered. The more U.S. chips are associated with embedded enforcement mechanisms, the more room there may be for international competitors to offer trusted alternatives, intentionally or not.

The controversy surrounding Nvidia’s H20 chip in Chinaoffersan early example of how embedded security features can provoke diplomatic and commercial backlash. In July 2025, the Cyberspace Administration of China summoned Nvidia to addressalleged“backdoor security risks” in its H20 chips, which were custom-designed for the Chinese market. Chinese regulators cited claims, originating from U.S. experts, that the chips could be used to track user locations or be remotely disabled.

The episode came just weeks after the Trump administration reversed an earlier restriction on H20 chip sales to China. Nvidia strongly denied the presence of any backdoors, but the controversy emphasized the diplomatic fragility that accompanies embedded security features, even when framed as compliance tools rather than control mechanisms.

This recent incident echoes a broader historical pattern, where security measures, however well-intentioned, risk triggering international backlash and long-term reputational damage. The Clipper chip episode of the 1990s serves as a historical warning about how security mandates can undermine trust in U.S. technology. The Clipper chip, a National Security Agency–backed initiative toembedencryption keys accessible to the government in consumer devices, triggered global backlash. European and Asian firms beganofferingalternatives to the Clipper chip marketed on privacy and sovereignty grounds, while U.S. tech companies saw reputational damage and commercial losses. The parallels with the Chip Security Act are striking. A well-intentioned national security initiative can erode market confidence and provide competitors with a clear branding advantage: the ability to sell trust.

In this environment, even narrowly targeted measures can generate outsized geopolitical consequences. China hasseizedon these dynamics to advance its domestic AI industry and portray U.S. controls as proof of the need for digital self-reliance. While the Chip Security Act targets only the most advanced data center–grade AI chips, the broader strategic and political effects are likely to extend beyond this scope. Beijing has alreadyusedearlier export controls to justify large-scale investment in domestic firms like Biren and Moore Threads, which now anchor its push for full-stack AI independence. Even limited tracking requirements can and will beportrayedby Beijing as evidence of U.S. overreach, reinforcing China’s drive for indigenous alternatives and digital sovereignty and encouraging nonaligned countries to reconsider the neutrality of U.S. supply chains.

Within this shifting landscape, U.S. chipmakers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), and Intel have remained publicly cautious. While they have not openly opposed the Chip Security Act, they also have not endorsed its provisions. Their posture reflects broader industry sensitivity to proposals that embed compliance mechanisms directly into hardware. The primary concern is not the technical cost of implementation, but rather the strategic risks such features maypose, particularly in markets where sovereignty and supply chain neutrality are prioritized. For globally integrated firms, enforcement hooks that accompany the product risk recasting U.S. chips as tools of extraterritorial regulation rather than neutral infrastructure.

As the geopolitical context of advanced semiconductors intensifies, governments seek new ways to enforce export controls beyond traditional licensing and inspection regimes. Location verification has emerged as a proposed compliance mechanism to bridge the gap between regulatory intent and real-world enforcement capacity. However, the debate over location-based compliance sits at the intersection of strategic technology control, cybersecurity, and supply chain governance.

Proponents of the Chip Security Actarguethat the bill offers a pragmatic solution to persistent enforcement blind spots without imposing intrusive surveillance or remote-control capabilities. They frame the proposed mechanisms, such as export certificates embedded in firmware and periodic Transport Layer Security (TLS)-based location checks, as minimally invasive tools to help the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) detect illicit diversion. TLS-based location verification meansverifyingthat a chip or a system is connecting from an authorized geographic location by embedding geolocation metadata or cryptographic certificates within the TLS handshake process, without exposing sensitive user data. These mechanisms, supporters argue, do notalterchip performance or collect user data but instead generate investigative signals that can flag suspicious behavior. By requiring tamper-resistant verification, the act aims to raise the cost of black-market smuggling, particularly through shell companies and permissive jurisdictions.

Proponents also point to parallels in other sectors, such as enterprise networking and cloud access control, where similar compliance signals support visibility without undermining functionality. They further emphasize that the bill allows for flexible implementation through driver-level authentication or software updates, avoiding the need for invasive firmware changes.

Critics, however, see the act as a fragile technical work-around masquerading as a strategy. In their view, the bill underestimates adversaries’ ability to spoof or circumvent location checks while overestimating the degree of control physical chip tracking provides. Oncedeployedin multi-tenant servers or integrated into broader systems, AI chips become nearly impossible to monitor meaningfully through geolocation alone; a chip in Singapore might serve a U.S. university or a Chinese military contractor, and location tells little about actual use.

Second, theproposedtriangulation methods are highly susceptible to spoofing via VPNs, proxies, or artificial delays, particularly from state actors like China that control network infrastructure.

Third,embeddedtelemetry features also pose cybersecurity risks: “Calling home” opens attack surfaces that could be exploited for surveillance or sabotage. Further, requiring embedded geotracking in high-performance AI chips wouldimposesignificant nonrecurring engineering burdens.

Fourth, the act’s six-month implementation deadline compounds these challenges. Major design and manufacturing changes typically take two to three years to move from concept through validation. Premature mandates could saddle U.S. firms with costly compliance burdens while delivering little real security.

While location verification is framed as a straightforward compliance tool, its practicalfeasibilityis far less certain. Advanced chips themselves lack native connectivity, and many data centers operate behind firewalls, with intermittent or no external internet access, or are intentionally air-gapped for security reasons. Further, hyperscalers also rarely run all purchased chipssimultaneously, meaning that the absence of a signal cannot be reliably equated with diversion or tampering. Hyperscalers are technology companies that operate vast, globally distributed data centers capable of rapidly expanding computing, storage, and networking capacity to meet demand. By designing their own hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, they deliver large-scale digital services and power emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Leading examples include Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, whose hyperscale operations underpin much of today’s cloud and AI ecosystem.

Moreover, the “trusted server network” provisioned by the Chip Security Act does not yet exist, and building such a global infrastructure would require significant international coordination and investment. Without these prerequisites, the proposal rests on assumptions of universal connectivity that do not reflect operational realities, making enforcement inconsistent at best and misleading at worst.

Designing a leading-edge AI GPU already costsupwardsof $500 million at the 5-nanometer (nm) node, with projections exceeding $700 million for 3 nm and below. The 5 nm and 3 nm nodesreferto advanced semiconductor manufacturing generations that indicate how small and densely packed a chip’s transistors are, with smaller nodes enabling higher performance and efficiency but at much greater design and production cost. Toimplementlocation verification at scale, companies like Nvidia would need two components: a firmware update enabling rapid location checks (estimated at under $1 million) and a global network of 100–500 trusted landmark servers, costing $2.5–12.5 million annually.

Beyond technical costs, firms would face ongoing management overhead, including export-specific compliance processes, audits, incident response playbooks, and coordination across legal, engineering, and sales teams. For globally integrated companies, these burdens compound operational complexity without offering clear commercial upside. More strategically, critics warn that embedding traceability features mayerodetrust in U.S. chips, prompting customers in key markets to shift toward non-U.S. suppliers viewed as more neutral or less vulnerable to embedded controls.

The Chip Security Act assumes that denying China access to advanced U.S. chips will significantly slow its frontier AI progress. Yet China’s ecosystem—illustrated by the rise of labs like DeepSeek—shows that controls can delay but not decisively block development. DeepSeek hasbuiltcompetitive large language models using a mix of pre-ban chips, sanctioned imports, and smuggled hardware, highlighting persistent enforcement gaps. These flows, worth billions of dollars, havebluntedthe impact of 2022–2023 export controls. Addressing this challenge requires more than technical fixes; it demandsstrongerinstitutional capacity at BIS, which today lacks the scale, tools, and reach to monitor chips across complex global supply chains.

Hardware mandates cannot replace intelligence-drivenenforcement. Strengthening U.S. capacity to track GPU end-use, expand counterproliferation tools, and share information with allies is essential to disrupt diversion networks. Smart monitoring of end-use patterns will deliver more durable security than embedding technical fixes into hardware.

While the Chip Security Act attempts to close this gap by embedding location verification features into hardware—an approach that shifts part of the enforcement burden to the chip itself—technical signals alone cannot substitute for strategic enforcement infrastructure. Sustaining U.S. advantage in a contested AI landscape will require not just smarter chips, but smarter institutions empowered to monitor, investigate, and disrupt illicit flows in real time.

As BIS leadership hasemphasizedin recent testimony, there is a need for enhancing legal authority, investigative capacity, and international coordination to bolster export control mechanisms. Strengthening these pillars would allow BIS to detect and disrupt illicit supply chains through targeted investigations, interagency intelligence sharing, and bilateral enforcement partnerships more effectively. Increased funding would support the expansion of BIS’s Export Enforcement and Office of Technology Evaluation, investment in advanced supply chain analytics, and more rigorous end-use checks overseas.

Additional investigative personnel, including attachés embedded with foreign governments, would improve monitoring of third-country transshipment routes and shell company networks. Stronger international coordination, through data-sharing agreements and jointinvestigationswith customs and export control authorities in key diversion hubs such as the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, would help close critical enforcement gaps that no embedded hardware feature can address.

To sustain leadership in AI and semiconductors, the United States must focus on a broader capability-driven strategy thatadvancesthe goals outlined in the administration’s AI Action Plan: expanding global AI alliances, countering adversary influence, and securing the AI technology stack through coordinated governance and enforcement.

To uphold theeffectivenessof export controls in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, the United States must expand the institutional capacity of the BIS. BIS is tasked with enforcing export laws, yet it remains under-resourced relative to the scale of the challenge. Strengthening enforcement requires expanding staffing, deploying attachés to key transshipment hubs, and investing in advanced supply chain analytics to track chip diversion and end-use patterns in high-risk jurisdictions. These capabilities areessentialfor identifying illicit flows, closing enforcement gaps, and reinforcing the credibility of U.S. technology controls.

Before mandating chip-level controls, the U.S. should ensure technical feasibility through an independent review led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As the government’s standards body, NIST is best placed to validate solutions with industry and allies, reducing fragmentation and ensuring that any requirements are practical, secure, and widely trusted. A NIST-led process would also help separate credible, scalable technologies from unproven startup claims, grounding policy in independent science rather than vendor assurances. Anchoring technical standards in a transparent and collaborative framework is essential for the United States to strengthen both the security and legitimacy of its export control system.

Rather than relying solely on restrictive mandates, the United States shouldencouragevoluntary end-user verification mechanisms that reward transparency and responsible behavior. This approach allows trusted firms to access U.S. technology under streamlined conditions, while reserving punitive measures for persistent noncompliance. Hence, by working with allies and partners to implement aligned standards, the U.S. can build a trusted AI export ecosystem that counters adversarial misuse without burdening legitimate innovation. This framework supports both commercial competitiveness and national security by fostering a network of reliable and accountable AI actors.

As AI development increasingly shifts from local infrastructure to scalable, on-demand cloud platforms, U.S. export controls must evolve accordingly. Today, adversaries no longer need toimportphysical chips; they can simply rent high-performance compute from U.S. cloud providers to train frontier models. This loophole undermines the intent of export restrictions and exposes U.S.-origin technology to strategic misuse. Without clear rules for cloud computing, efforts to constrain the diffusion of dual-use AI capabilities risk becoming obsolete.

The goal of cloud restrictions is not to monitor, but to ensure accountability in how advanced compute is used. Just as banks are required to verify their customers to prevent illicit finance, cloud service providers should be required to verify and monitor high-risk AI workloads. Proposals such as the ENFORCE Act and H.R. 4683markimportant steps toward building an oversight architecture that matches the realities of modern compute delivery. These frameworks would enable regulators to detect and disrupt malicious actors without placing undue burden on trusted users.

Done right, cloud restrictions can enhance, not inhibit, U.S. competitiveness. By establishing standards for responsible AI use in the cloud, the U.S. can build a coalition of trusted providers and democratic partners who agree on baseline safeguards.

Finally, control alone is not sufficient to build lasting technological leadership; it must be matched by proactive investment in the capabilities that drive long-term advantage. Hence, to maintain leadership in AI, the United States mustinvestin the foundations of technological strength—world-class talent and universities—and fully support cutting-edge research. Export controls may impose short-term constraints on adversaries, but they cannot substitute sustained investments in innovation at competitive levels. This requires expanding funding for foundational and applied AI research, fostering public-private research and development collaboration, and building career pathways to develop and retain top technical talent in critical sectors. Just as vital is strengthening supply chain partnerships to ensure that U.S. technology remains a trusted, high-quality choice for allies and partners around the world.

The Chip Security Act seeks to address real vulnerabilities in the current export control system, but embedding compliance into hardware is not a substitute for strategic enforcement. Many of the act’s proposed technical mechanisms still require clarification—on feasibility, interoperability, and security—to ensure they do not introduce new risks or hinder competitiveness. As AI development moves to the cloud and global competition intensifies, U.S. leadership will hinge less on restrictive mechanisms and more on continued innovation backed by resilient institutions, credible governance, and trusted supply chains.

To stay ahead, the United States must modernize its enforcement architecture, bolster BIS capacity, extend oversight to virtual compute, and coordinate with allies to align standards. Export controls should enable innovation, not constrain it, and above all, not erode confidence and acceptance of U.S. high-tech manufacturing equipment and products. By investing in capability, not just control, the United States can preserve its edge in AI infrastructure while upholding the trust that sustains its global leadership.

Export Controls: More Harm Than Good? | Marco Macchiavelli

Why Giving Up on Export Controls Is Giving Up on the Tech Race | Navin Girishankar and Matthew S. Borman

Marco Macchiavelli, Assistant Professor of Finance, University of Massachusetts Amherst

In the midst of the current technological rivalry between the United States and China, the U.S. government hasemployedexport controls torestrictChina from acquiring advanced domestic technology. In particular, the Department of Commerce has the power to forbid domestic firms from exporting certain technologies to a list of Chinese entities, such as Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The purpose of U.S. export controls is to safeguard the technological competitive edge of the U.S. economy and to limit the transfer of dual-use technologies to China and its military.

However, by their very nature, export controls harm the profitability of domestic firms producing the very same technologies that export controls are trying to safeguard. Indeed, as documented inCrosignani et al. (2024), once their Chinese customers are subject to export controls, domestic firms experience a decline in revenues, profitability, and stock market capitalization. The decline in revenues comes from the fact that these domestic firms cannot easily find alternative non-Chinese customers to make up for the loss in revenues caused by export controls. If the U.S. government is keen to continue using export controls, it seems natural to ask whether it should incentivize the reshoring of critical high-value-added segments of the supply chain to the United States. The main concern is that incentives given to inefficient national champions, such as Intel, may ultimately waste taxpayer money and add production capacity to firms that are far behind the cutting edge, ultimately worsening the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.

To holistically assess the effectiveness of export controls, we still need a few questions answered.

First, the issue of circumvention. A few non-U.S. firms build machinery that is instrumental for the production of advanced technologies. See, for instance, the case of ASML, the most advanced producer of lithographic tools that are necessary for advanced microchips. ASML was selling its machines to China until the U.S. government successfullylobbiedthe Dutch government to stop it. Circumvention takes place in other ways too, including setting up front companies that purchase the restricted technologies under a false identity, only to reexport them to the very same Chinese firms subject to export controls. Notice that reexport is a violation of export controls, but it is challenging to enforce. Recentreportsindeed suggest that some AI chips subject to export controls were smuggled to China.

Second, as with any intervention, we need to consider the so-called blowback, namely the counteracting force that may ultimately blunt the usefulness of export controls. Are export controls forcing China to decouple from the United States even faster, and to double down on indigenous innovation to substitute the U.S. technologies under export controls? Are export controls intensifying intellectual property (IP) theft by China? There is little to no empirical evidence to assess the magnitude of these channels, and more research is needed. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that China is getting closer to the cutting edge in advanced technologies. After an almost complete collapse as the first export controls were introduced in 2019, Huawei shocked markets in 2023 when it unveiled a new phone containing advanced chips. Similarly, DeepSeekrattledthe AI sector when it displayedcompetitiveoutcomes at a fraction of the computational cost.

And finally, the most important question. What is the goal here? China has become very efficient at scaling manufacturing in record times, something that no other country seems to be able to do at that same level of efficiency. As such, China has become a key partner to U.S. businesses, including Apple. The main justification for U.S. countermeasures is the persistent and pervasive use of espionage tactics to conduct IP theft from U.S. companies, government labs, and universities. The goal of an economic strategy toward China should be to maintain economic synergies while preserving domestic IP protection. Moreover, if the United States wants to maintain leverage on China, export controls are clearly a self-inflicted wound as they reduce domestic leverage and instead boost Chinese independence from the U.S. economic orbit.

Navin Girishankar, President, Economic Security and Technology Department, and Matt Borman, Senior Technical Expert (Non-resident), Economic Security and Technology Department

Any serious debate about export controls—a tool to protect U.S. and allied national security in today’s tech race—must start with a blunt fact: the United States now faces a wider set of threats from adversaries, chiefly the People’s Republic of China (PRC), than it did from the Soviet Union. There are national security threats, including Beijing’s declared policy of civil-military fusion, designed to rapidly channel commercial breakthroughs into military capabilities aimed at the United States and its allies. There are collateral threats to U.S. technology leadership: China is an innovation competitor with a surging research base, its firms are battle-tested in global competition, and its ecosystems are poised to lock in advantage across life sciences, robotics, climate tech, and potentially quantum communications. And there are economic security threats: China is not only embedded in global technology markets but also able and practiced in using malign and mercantile tactics—IP theft, coercive partnerships, state-subsidized dumping—to acquire advanced technologies, build capacity, and seize market share.

Most critics of export controls, underplay—or like Marco Macchiavelli—simply do not acknowledge the threats to U.S. and allied national security that undermine the integrity of technology markets, the security of the United States’ assets (including intangible assets such as ideas), and the long-term incentives for U.S. companies to grow and compete. He correctly notes—but overweights—the concern that export controls cut off U.S. companies from China’s large, competitive, and increasingly innovative market. Let’s take his case point by point.

Profitability.Macchiavelli claims export controls hurt U.S. companies’ profitability. True—they impose costs and lost sales. But the relevant measure is the relative competitive position of firms. Effective controls mean blocking access from both U.S. and non-U.S. sources to prevent erosion of market share to foreign competitors. The real risk is not missing a sale to Huawei—it is allowing foreign competitor firms to undercut U.S. controls, allowing China to reach the frontier faster, develop substitutes, and then reenter global markets, including ours, on terms that displace American products. That scenario is far more damaging to long-term U.S. technological leadership and U.S. national security that comes from technology leadership, than the immediate loss of export revenue. This is precisely why export controls must be coordinated with allies to close off alternative supply routes.

Circumvention.Macchiavelli is correct to point out that front companies and gray markets exist. But leaping from implementation challenges to discounting the very use of export controls is overkill. Without export controls, PRC-linked firms would not need to circumvent anything—access to advanced, dual-use capabilities would be wide open. The real test is whether controls raise costs, slow timelines, and create friction. Evidence says they do: PRC AI developers are payingdouble market pricesfor smuggled, leading-edge chips, moving them through complex third-country transshipments. That is not seamless access—that is delay and disruption. Even with massive annual government subsidies, China’s indigenous chip production capabilities continue to lag behind leading-edge capabilities. And when key allies in Europe and Asia limit key exports, the effect compounds: local enforcement plus U.S. coordination yields better compliance and stronger impact.

Design-Out.Macchiavelli’s “design-out” argument—that controls spur China to innovate around them—is valid.Some of our CSIS scholarshave pointed out this risk, but it ignores the counterfactual. Beijing’s self-sufficiency drive predates the current export control policy. Indeed, it is a central plank of Chinese industrial strategy, enshrined in initiatives like “Made in China 2025” and the 14th Five-Year Plan’s push for “technology independence.” Again, the relevant question is whether the PRC’s advances would be faster or slower without controls. The evidence suggests that export controls have bought time—giving the United States a “commanding lead” in key dimensions of the AI competition, and through allied cooperation, ensuring that China’sdomestically produced semiconductor equipment toolsand chips remain behind, despite massive state investment. Granted, buying time is valuable only if the United States uses it to invest and innovate—a question that deserves more attention and scrutiny.

A Tool, Not a Strategy.Export controls are a tool, not a strategy. To be effective, they should be deployed in service of clear goals and complemented by other economic tools. Here, we agree with Macchiavelli, although he appears skeptical of any form of industrial policy, including the use of national champions. That’s a worthwhile debate—what is the right mix of tools to securitize U.S. innovation? Is combining export controls with subsidized national champions more or less effective than using export controls along with domestic deregulation and investment attraction policies?

Beyond China.Macchiavelli misses that export controls, as an instrument of U.S. national security policy, matter far beyond the China context. Since 2022, they have eroded Russia’s ability to produce precision missiles by increasing costs and forcing reliance on inferior substitutes. These benefits should be acknowledged, even while noting Russia’s ability to acquire chips from the PRC and other sources. The larger point is that, in an age of multipolar technology risks, the United States requires export controls for more than one adversary.

Like any other economic tool, export controls are not perfect. They must continue to evolve to address modern threats related to the AI diffusion, quantum computing, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. Discounting them based on a lopsided understanding of their role in economic and national security would be to accept a faster erosion of the very technological edge that underwrites U.S. security.

Going forward, the efficacy of export controls will depend on setting clear goals, as Macchiavelli correctly points out—but it will also depend on targeting technologies where the returns to national security are greatest, establishing metrics to evaluate impact, monitoring their impact in near-real time, and coordinating with allies. It will also require adequate resourcing for the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security to expand technological expertise, enforcement capacity, and engagement with allies.

Such efforts, however, will be diminished if export controls are used as bargaining chips in trade talks. For this reason, the Trump administration’s recent reversal on restrictions on chips in response to China’s easing of its rare earth restrictions, as well asreportsthat licenses are being provided to U.S. companies in exchange for a share of export revenues, is worrying. Such moves suggest that this vital tool in America’s economic security arsenal is transactional rather than principled, negotiable rather than inviolable.

CSIS,China’s New Rare Earth and Magnet Restrictions Threaten U.S. Defense Supply Chains,"Published October 9, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains,"In advance of President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to South Korea later this month—where he is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time since 2019—China announced that it has expanded its restrictions on rare earth and permanent magnet exports. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce’sAnnouncement No. 61 of 2025implements the strictest rare earth and permanent magnet export controls to date. The move both strengthens Beijing’s leverage in upcoming talks while also undercutting U.S. efforts to bolster its industrial base.

Q1: What is new about today’s rare earth and permanent magnet export restrictions?

A1:The new export controls mark the first time China has applied the foreign direct product rule (FDPR)—a mechanism introduced in1959and long used by Washington to restrictsemiconductor exportsto China. The FDPR enables the United States to regulate the sale of foreign-made products if they incorporate U.S. technology, software, or equipment, even when produced by non-U.S. companies abroad. In effect, if U.S. technology appears anywhere in the supply chain, Washington can assert jurisdiction.

Under the measures announced today, foreign firms will now be required to obtain Chinese government approval to export magnets that contain even trace amounts of Chinese-origin rare earth materials—or that were produced using Chinese mining, processing, or magnet-making technologies. The new licensing framework will apply to foreign-produced rare earth magnets and select semiconductor materials that contain at least0.1 percentheavy rare earth elements sourced from China.

Given China’sdominancein the sector—accounting for roughly 70 percent of rare earth mining, 90 percent of separation and processing, and 93 percent of magnet manufacturing—these developments will have major national security implications.

Q2: What do the new restrictions mean for the defense and semiconductor industries?

A2: Rare earths are crucial for variousdefense technologies, including F-35 fighter jets, Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines, Tomahawk missiles, radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of smart bombs. The United States is already struggling to keep pace in the production of these systems. Meanwhile, China is rapidly scaling up its munitions manufacturing capacity and acquiring advanced weapons platforms and equipment at a rate estimated to befive to six times fasterthan that of the United States.

The newly announced restrictions represent China’s most consequential measures to date targeting the defense sector. Under the new rules, starting December 1, 2025, companies with any affiliation to foreign militaries—including those of the United States—will be largely denied export licenses. The Ministry of Commerce also made clear that any requests to use rare earths for military purposes will be automatically rejected. In effect, the policy seeks to prevent direct or indirect contributions of Chinese-origin rare earths or related technologies to foreign defense supply chains.

Even before these latest measures, the U.S. defense industrial basefaced significant challengesand had limited production capacity and limited ability to rapidly scale to meet rising defense technology needs. The new restrictions will only deepen these vulnerabilities, further widening thecapability gapand allowing China to accelerate the expansion of its military strength at a faster pace than the United States at a time when tension is rising in the Indo-Pacific region.

Additionally, export license applications for rare earth materials used in highly advanced technologies, including sub-14-nanometer semiconductors, next-generation memory chips, semiconductor manufacturing or testing equipment, will now be subject to case-by-case review by Chinese authorities. Companies will likely need to provide detailed documentation on end users, technical specifications, and intended applications before any export is authorized. The individualized review process gives Chinese authorities significant discretion to delay, deny, or condition exports, effectively introducing a new layer of strategic control over the global supply of rare earth inputs critical to advanced computing and defense technologies.

Q3: How is China tightening control over the outflow of its skills and technologies?

A3:Under the new measures, Chinese nationals are barred from engaging in or providing support for overseas projects involving rare earth exploration, extraction, processing, or magnet manufacturing unless they first obtain explicit authorization from Chinese authorities. By tightening control over the movement of expertise, China aims to prevent the outflow of proprietary technologies and know-how that have made it the global leader in rare earth mining and magnet production. These restrictions build on therare earth processing technology export banin December 2023.

Q4: Why are the new export restrictions likely a negotiation tactic?

A4:In itsannouncement, the Ministry of Commerce stated that China remains open to enhancing communication and cooperation with other countries through both multilateral and bilateral export control dialogues. The ministry emphasized that such dialogue seeks to promote compliant trade while protecting the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.

Q5: How do these restrictions build on China’s earlier rare earth export controls?

A5:The new measures mark a sharp escalation in Beijing’s long-running strategy to weaponize its dominance in rare earths. Chinaannounceda ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies on December 21, 2023. On April 4, 2025, the Ministry of Commerceintroducedexport restrictions on seven rare earth elements in retaliation for President Trump’s new tariffs on Chinese goods.

Subsequent diplomacy offered only a temporary reprieve. During the May 11talksin Switzerland, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, which included removing U.S. companies from China’s trade blacklist and restoring their access to rare earth supplies. Yet stability proved short-lived: U.S. manufacturers soon began shutting down production amid ongoing shortages, as China delayed the issuance of export licenses despite not formally abandoning the deal. Tensions flared again when President Trump accused Beijing of backtracking on its commitments. Ultimately, on June 11, 2025, following two days of negotiations in London attended by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, both sidesreacheda new trade framework—but the episode underscored how Beijing’s rare earth policy has evolved into a potent instrument of economic and geopolitical leverage.

Q6: What is the United States doing to build its rare earth and permanent magnet capabilities to reduce China’s leverage?

A6:Noveon Magnetics is currently the only manufacturer of rare earth magnets in the United States. This week, Noveon Magnetics and Lynas Rare Earths announced a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic partnership focused on building a scalable, domestic supply chain for rare earth permanent magnets in the United States.

In July 2025, as part of a landmark agreement, the Department of Defense (recently renamed the Department of War) invested $400 million in equity into MP Materials, making the U.S. government the company’s largest shareholder. The deal also includes a 10-year price floor commitment of $110 per kilogram for MP Materials’ NdPr (neodymium-praseodymium) products, designed to protect the commercial viability of the company amidst low prices stemming from Chinese overproduction. Additionally, the Department of War’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) has extended a $150 million loan to expand MP Materials’ Mountain Pass, California, facility, adding heavy rare earth separation capabilities to strengthen domestic processing capacity. MP Materials has also announced plans to build its second U.S. magnet manufacturing facility, known as the “10X Facility.” The Department of War has entered into a 10-year offtake agreement for 100 percent of the facility’s magnet output. It will take time to ramp up these capabilities. Until then, China retains a significant amount of leverage over supply chains crucial for national and economic security.

CSIS,Countering China’s Challenge to American AI Leadership,"Published December 2, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/countering-chinas-challenge-american-ai-leadership,"Greg Allen testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, & International Cybersecurity Policy regarding China’s strategy for AI diffusion, the interplay between economic security and national security, and the costs and benefits of regulation.

Chairman Ricketts, Ranking Member Shaheen, distinguished Members of the Committee, I am honored to share my views with you on this important topic. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) does not take policy positions, so the views represented in this testimony are my own and not those of my current or former employer.

I currently serve as the Senior Advisor for the Wadhwani AI Center at CSIS, where I conduct policy research at the intersection of technology, economics, and national security. Prior to CSIS, I spent three years working at the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where I served as the director for strategy and policy, and participated directly in government-to-government conversations with China and the People’s Liberation Army related to AI. My primary professional background is corporate strategy roles in technology-driven industries, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, robotics, and space systems. Over the past ten years, I have focused intensely on the geopolitical and national security implications of Artificial Intelligence technology with a special emphasis on U.S.-China competition. My remarks today reflect my conclusions from the research I have conducted while at CSIS as well as my prior professional experiences.

To begin, both the current administration of President Donald Trump and the prior administration of President Biden have likened the current race in AI between the United States and China to the Cold War-era space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. This is a helpful analogy in terms of capturing the strategic importance of this competition. However, the current AI race is bigger in terms of its absolute scale and different in its competitive dynamics. Between 1960 and 1973, the United States government spent $28 billion on the Apollo program, which is the equivalent of $326 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars.1In 2026, just five U.S. companies—Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle—are expected to spend more than $450 billion2in aggregate AI-specific capital expenditures. Other U.S. companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI, will add hundreds of billions of additional investment to that total. This reflects the fact that far more of the activity of the AI race is taking place in the commercial private sector than was the case with the space race. Overall, U.S. companies will invest far more in AI in a single year than the entire U.S. government spent over the entire 13-year life of the Apollo program. AI investment is not only bigger than Apollo in inflation adjusted dollars, but it is also bigger as a share of U.S. gross domestic product. The investment firm Goldman Sachs estimates that total AI-related investment in the United States already represents 1 percent of U.S. GDP,3whereas during its peak years the Apollo program comprised only 0.4% of GDP.4

The United States government is not directing U.S. companies to invest such astonishing sums of money, so why are they doing it? The clearest answer comes from Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, who claimed earlier this year that leading AI systems “will exhibit all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 years” and that the AI revolution is “going to be 10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.”5Leadership in a revolution that transformative provides a free market incentive sufficiently large to justify such investments, and the current demand for AI services is already enormous. Google reports that even the eight-year old versions of its AI chips are 100 percent utilized.6

The most obvious product of these investments is the computing hardware infrastructure—data centers full of advanced AI chips—that powers AI software. The largest single AI datacenter cluster as of March 20257included more than 200,000 AI chips and is planned to grow to more than one million8AI chips in the near future. The current market price for the leading AI chips is in the range of $25,000-$60,000, implying chip costs alone in the tens of billions of dollars for a leading AI facility.

Experts in China have also paid close attention to the strategic importance of AI chips. A 2018 report9by Tsinghua University in Beijing put it in stark terms:

“Whether it is the realization of algorithms, the acquisition and a massive database, or the computing capability, the secret behind the rapid development of the AI industry lies in the one and only physical basis, that is, the chips. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say, ‘No chip, no AI’ given the irreplaceable role of AI chip as the cornerstone for AI development and its strategic significance.”

Thus, the most strategically significant move that the U.S. government has taken in the AI race with China to date is working to deny China access to the most advanced AI chips and also to deny China the means to make its own chips. Key aspects of this strategy began during the first Trump administration and then were greatly expanded during the Biden administration. While the implementation of this strategy has been flawed (as I have repeatedly written10,11,12,13,14about), it has nevertheless contributed significantly to continued overall U.S. leadership in AI.

If the Biden administration had not blocked exports of advanced AI chips, it is possible, perhaps even likely, that the first million chip AI cluster would be built in China, rather than the United States. China has many advantages in the AI race and the disparity in computing resources stands out as almost certainly the largest single advantage that the United States enjoys over China. Two senior executives in key Chinese AI firms have explicitly stated that lack of access to advanced AI chips is the most significant challenge that they face. In May 2025, Wang Qi, still vice-president at Tencent’s cloud computing unit, said that “The most severe problem is the [limited] resources of [graphics] cards and computing resources,” and that tighter U.S. export controls would, “widen the gap [regarding AI adoption] between China and the US in the short term.”15Similarly, in July 2024, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng said, “We do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.”16Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must use two to four times the computing power to achieve the same results, referring to the penalty of using Nvidia H800 chips instead of H100 chips for large model training.17

Similarly, if the first Trump administration had not blocked Chinese chipmakers from acquiring advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, such as Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) tools it is possible that Chinese chip-making firms would be at or near parity with the global leaders. Without access to such equipment, China’s most advanced producer of logic chips, SMIC, has been stuck at the 7 nanometer (nm) technology node for years and may continue to be stuck there for more years to come. According to a report,18SMIC had placed an order for an EUV lithography tool in April 2018 prior to being blocked.

The first Trump administration also blocked leading Chinese chip designers, such as Huawei’s HiSilicon subsidiary, from accessing U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment via contract manufacturers such as Taiwan’s TSMC. In August 2018, Huawei was the second company to launch a 7 nm smartphone application processor, the Kirin 980, trailing Apple’s A12 by mere weeks.19Huawei launched an HiSilicon-designed, TSMC-manufactured 7 nm AI accelerator chip, the first Ascend 910, in mid-2019. Huawei deployed it with commercial partners later that year.20Nvidia did not begin selling its first 7 nm AI accelerator, the A100, until 2020.21At the time, Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called 3-5-2 policy,22in which the CCP’s Central Office ordered all government agencies and many state-owned enterprises23to eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years. However, Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration’s updated 2020 entity listing,24which temporarily cut Huawei’s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC. Apple,25TSMC, and Nvidia were all major beneficiaries of these early U.S. export controls, which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI and semiconductor technology.

It is worth stressing that the competitive dynamics in the Chinese market are not the same as those outside of it. The competitive advantages that have resulted in Nvidia leading in the AI chip market around the world are not enough to guarantee a leading position in the Chinese market. This is because Chinese firms benefit from dramatic government support (including forced technology transfer, industrial espionage, and intellectual property violations) and because the Chinese domestic market is in and of itself large enough to reach globally-relevant economies of scale, which was not the case for the export-dependent growth strategies of South Korea or Taiwan.

There is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s rate of technological progress. China’s greatest progress came in sectors with no export controls.

A September 2024 analysis by Bernstein Research, an equity research firm, included a review of China’s semiconductor self-sufficiency goals from the 2015 roadmap and found that “China has made impressive progress and likely will beat the ‘Made in China 2025’ targets for integrated circuit (IC) Design and Manufacturing, but may miss the goals for IC equipment and Materials.” As the Bernstein analysis shows, the rate of China’s progress toward self-sufficiency is best predicted by the market and technological complexities of each semiconductor market segment, not by the extent to which export controls were applied. It is certainly not the case that the segments in which China has made the most progress—or even devoted the most resources—are the areas in which the United States has applied export controls most forcefully.

That there is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s technological progress should be obvious given that China has made rapid progress26in other technological domains—such as solar cells27and electric vehicles28(EVs)—where the United States applied no export controls and in some cases actively supported the rise of a Chinese supply chain. The United States applied no export controls in the case of the equipment used to manufacture silicon solar cells, yet today China dominates29both production of solar cells and production of the equipment used to make them. This equipment is in many ways similar to (though less sophisticated than) the equipment used to make and process silicon wafers for semiconductors. In fact, one Chinese company, Naura, is a domestic leader in both manufacturing equipment for both solar cells and semiconductors. The biggest difference in Chinese outcomes between those two industries is not the presence or absence of export controls but the far greater technological complexity of producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

The EV maker Tesla made a major push into Chinese manufacturing in late 2018, launching deep partnerships with many local Chinese suppliers, such as battery-maker CATL. As a November 2024 commentary in a major Chinese state-run newspaper stated:

""Tesla’s rapid growth in sales, fueled by its technological and branding advantages and backed by China’s massive consumer market, has driven the rapid development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Today, the localization rate of parts for Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, with more than 60 suppliers integrated into Tesla’s global supply chain.""30

The Chinese EV supply chain, which Tesla helped dramatically increase in both scale and technological sophistication, is now also supplying Tesla’s competitors.31Defections of Tesla-trained skilled employees are also a challenge. An April 2024 New York Times report32claimed that most of Tesla’s early Chinese employees now work at competing Chinese firms. In a January Tesla earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said33“The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. . . . Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world.” In October 2025, Carlos Tavares, the former CEO of Stellantis (which owns Chrysler) predicted34that Tesla will “end up completely overtaken by Chinese manufacturers.”

The point here is not to suggest with unwarranted certainty that export controls would have definitively prevented China’s rise in the solar and EV industries. Rather, it is to caution the against those who rely too heavily on cursory anecdotal evidence to reach conclusions about when export controls do or do not work and what the counterfactual outcome would have been if export controls were or were not applied. Much depends upon the state of the global market landscape, the complexity of the controlled technology, the current technological sophistication of the targeted country, the design of the export control regulations, and the robustness of the controls’ implementation and enforcement. Only a detailed analysis can hope to reach anything approaching insight.

Semiconductor export controls—as implemented thus far—have in different ways and at different times both helped and hindered Chinese firms.

Just as foreign firms have supported Chinese competitor growth in solar cells and EVs in the absence of export controls, so have they done in semiconductor manufacturing. The major semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers all have major service businesses, where, among other things, they train customer companies on how to get the most out of their equipment. Prior to the October 2022 changes in U.S. export controls, this could include assisting with the facility planning, installation, repairs, and operational troubleshooting of equipment as part of advanced chip manufacturing operations. Industry sources told me that this sometimes included contract research and development (R&D) of advanced node semiconductor process technology on behalf of or in partnership with Chinese clients. As of now, this is still legal in the case of providing support to Chinese legacy chip manufacturing operations, and there is reason to suspect that some Chinese firms have deceived U.S. firms in order to receive advice related to their advanced chipmaking efforts.

By contrast, earlier U.S. export controls meaningfully reversed progress in some segments of the Chinese semiconductor sector, such as NAND memory manufacturing and smartphone chip design, though the durability of those setbacks, even if temporary, will depend on many factors. More recent export controls have also made life harder in many ways for Chinese semiconductor equipment firms, who can no longer legally obtain U.S. subcomponents or technical expertise.

Thus, it is simply wrong to say that export controls always, in isolation, accelerate Chinese technological indigenization and that making it easier for U.S. firms to export will always slow Chinese indigenization.

At the same time, it is unambiguously the case that the United States’ use of semiconductor export controls, beginning with ZTE in April 2018, made a massive impression on both political and corporate leaders in China. Speeches at the time by Chinese leadership, including General Secretary Xi Jinping, indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point and justified China’s aggressive pursuit of “self-reliance” in science and technology. Pony Ma, the chairman of Tencent, one of China’s largest technology firms, said in May 2018, “The recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is, without mobile devices, without microchips and operating systems, we can’t compete competently.”

The evidence goes beyond talk to specific actions. China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE, and China’s central government directed local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector. Some Chinese companies also took drastic measures to respond after ZTE. For example, Nikkei Asia reported that Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC)—one of China’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturers—began a full-blown de-Americanization campaign in 2019 involving the full-time work of more than 800 staff (both YMTC and its suppliers). This included the establishment of multiple new major partnerships with domestic Chinese equipment producers. Of note, at the time when YMTC began this de-Americanization initiative, no significant U.S. export controls applied to the company. YMTC began their work based on fear of future controls, not the reality of current ones.

Combined, this provides strong evidence that the export controls did increase the desire of both the Chinese government and Chinese companies to increase the capabilities of local semiconductor equipment providers, but that is not the same thing as saying that export controls caused accelerated indigenization, which depends upon more than just desire.

I believe the most important export controls that the United States has established are those related to advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Export controls changed the composition of equipment demand both technologically (decreasing the technological sophistication of equipment purchased by China) and geographically (shifting more of advanced node demand outside of China and more legacy node demand to China) but likely did not change the overall demand trajectory.

China has continued to be a large and growing market for equipment exports even after the more recent export controls, but Chinese firms have changed their focus from a rush to compete at the most advanced semiconductor technological nodes to maximizing both domestic self-sufficiency and global leadership in legacy chip35production. China was likely to pursue a massive expansion36of chip production capacity regardless of U.S. actions, but the export controls helped ensure that this capacity did not drive the U.S. and allies toward a strategic dependence on China for the most technologically advanced chips, such as those that power AI systems or high-end smartphones.

Moreover, the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment fundamentally depends on the overall demand for manufactured chips. As the demand for advanced chips grows, that demand will translate into demand for advanced equipment. And if China is not in a position to purchase advanced equipment, then the purchase and production will instead take place outside of China. The chief financial officer of ASML, Roger Dassen, said37this explicitly during ASML’s July 2024 earnings call with investment analysts:

"". . . the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography. In this case, China. We look at—and that's the way we model our sales medium term and long term. We look at what is the global demand for wafers and whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model. We don't have a specific China element in our models. It is the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling.""

Accordingly, U.S. and allied controls did not so much destroy demand as change its composition. China is buying fewer advanced tools than it would have otherwise and is instead purchasing more legacy tools. The advanced tools that would have been sold to China have instead been sold to places like the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. Likewise, given that many foreign players are wary of investing in legacy nodes due to fears of Chinese overcapacity, the tools are being largely sold to China for those production lines, not elsewhere.

There is no change in U.S. or allied policy that will persuade the Chinese government and Chinese firms to abandon their semiconductor equipment de-Americanization and decoupling efforts. However, the United States can take steps to make those efforts more difficult and to extract more strategic benefits in semiconductor and AI competition.

Critics of export controls oftentimes make two related arguments. First, revenues from China can be reinvested in R&D and thus contribute to increased U.S. technological competitiveness, including against Chinese firms. Second, prohibiting exports increases willingness on the part of Chinese firms and the Chinese government to invest in competitors to U.S. firms, decreasing U.S. technological competitiveness.

However, these arguments assume that the strategic approach of the Chinese government and Chinese firms depends solely or primarily upon U.S. actions, which is contradicted by the review of Chinese policy at the beginning of this paper and from the experience of the EV and solar industries.

Consider a thought experiment: What would be the likely policy response of the Chinese government if the United States decided to begin unrestricted exports of nuclear submarines to China? U.S. nuclear submarines are widely regarded as the best in the world, and China’s spies have long devoted major efforts to stealing U.S. submarine technology secrets.

Presumably, therefore, China would leap at the chance to buy U.S. nuclear submarines on the open market. And, under the logic of the above two arguments—increased U.S. revenue and decreased Chinese investment—these sales would increase, not decrease, the U.S. technological advantage in nuclear submarine technology. Are American policymakers fools for using export controls to block nuclear submarine sales to China?

Of course not.

Even if a hypothetical reckless U.S. president and Congress were to allow China to buy as many submarines as U.S. firms could make, China would never accept that this state of affairs is likely to continue on a permanent basis. China would obviously take the submarines they could get and reverse engineer the technology as fast as possible and transfer that technology to their domestic submarine industry, which they would continue to financially support. The increased revenue from R&D for U.S. firms is not going to make nearly as much of a difference as China’s hands-on opportunity to reverse engineer U.S. technology. Neither would the lost sales among Chinese submarine manufacturers decrease China’s commitment to supporting a domestic industry. This is not to even mention the grave risks to national security of a hypothetical Chinese navy equipped with U.S.-built nuclear submarines.

This admittedly extreme thought experiment bears consideration because, while some in the West question whether semiconductor manufacturing equipment deserves to be viewed as a strategic technology of major importance to national security, China’s leaders do not. This belief is evident not only in words but also the deeds, whether that be Chinese state-backed espionage38against equipment firms, aggressive reverse engineering39of purchased Western equipment, or the astonishing amount of financial resources dedicated to indigenization.

There is simply no policy that the United States could articulate that would persuade China to abandon its goals of de-Americanization and decoupling in the semiconductor equipment sector. As the United States and allied governments consider reforms to semiconductor equipment controls, they should focus less on how to change China’s goals and more on how to make achieving those goals as expensive and complicated as possible.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions.

CSIS,DeepSeek: A Deep Dive,"Published April 8, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/deepseek-deep-dive,"Greg Allen testified before the House Science, Space, & Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology regarding DeepSeek’s AI and how Huawei’s chip gains highlight China’s growing edge in the U.S.–China tech race.

Chair Obernolte, Ranking Member Stevens, and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) does not take policy positions, so the views represented in this testimony are my own and should not be taken as representing those of my current or former employers.

I currently serve as the director of the Wadhwani AI Center at CSIS, where I lead a team conducting policy research at the intersection of technology, economics, and national security. Prior to CSIS, I spent three years working at the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where I most recently served as the director for strategy and policy. My primary professional background is corporate strategy roles in technology-driven industries. On March 7, 2025, I published a report through CSIS titled “DeepSeek, Huawei, Export Controls, and the Future of the U.S.-China AI Race,” and many of my remarks today reflect my conclusions from that research effort.

For my testimony today, I hope to offer a useful perspective on the origins of DeepSeek’s AI models and what DeepSeek’s progress in AI model development, as well as Huawei’s progress in AI chip design and manufacturing, mean for U.S. competition with China.

DeepSeek did not come out of nowhere. Its parent company, High-Flyer Capital Management, has roots in AI-enabled high frequency trading that provided a strong technical foundation in terms of both computing infrastructure and workforce talent. Algorithmic trading firms frequently own and operate their own data center infrastructure, which they use to develop proprietary investment strategies powered by machine learning artificial intelligence. These efforts routinely include intense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency. DeepSeek’s heritage from High-Flyer’s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models.

Many media and policy commentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China’s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities. There is some merit to aspects of the first claim, but the second is wrong.

To begin, DeepSeek’s V3 research paper states that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips, which, at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour, equates to $5.576 million. This was only the final, successful pretraining run. It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run, nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads. Thus, it is not an apples-to-apples fair comparison to say that DeepSeek’s AI model development cost only $5 million while American firms require hundreds of millions of dollars.

The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidia specifically developed for the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed on October 7, 2022. In particular, those controls restricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics: total processing power and interconnect speed.

Government sources told me that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its (at the time) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips. They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100, which was first introduced in 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors. Additionally, the U.S. government assumed that, if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other, this would require the typical multiyear AI chip development timeline.

However, Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products. Specifically, each Nvidia chip is designed for redundancy, recoverability, and defect tolerance to minimize the impact of manufacturing defects. Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed (but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines that were legal to export to China.

The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 chips meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China’s AI ecosystem. Former government officials told me that this was clear internally by December 2022. However, it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act. The U.S. government modified the export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s, H800s, and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China. During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal, an enormous number of them were sold to China. Precise sales figures are not available, but Nvidia’s disclosed sales to China between October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023, exceeded 9 billion dollars.

If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models, it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law, since the H100 has never been legally available in China and cannot even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China. Thus, if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity, it would have an incentive to conceal this fact. This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively.

While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023, industry sources told me that, by early 2024, large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway. In mid-2024, journalists at The Information interviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks, each of which provided evidence that they had completed H100 smuggling transactions worth more than $100 million.1These networks continue to be active, with increasingly sophisticated techniques for evading detection. For example, a December 2024 investigation by The Information found that

When notified of an upcoming inspection, smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they’ve purchased from Supermicro [and already smuggled to China] and attached them to other servers they had access to.2

More recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal suggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips.3China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) export control enforcement barrier. As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission, China has a reasonable expectation of success.4BIS needs not only more money, but also more skilled staff, more enforcement agents, and better enabling technology, especially in data analysis.

Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed to strong evidence that DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed: Many of DeepSeek’s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth. At a minimum, this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s.

This does not prove, however, that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure. Indeed, some reporting in Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls. The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis, citing anonymous industry sources, recently wrote that DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs, a category that includes H100s, H800s, and H20s. SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer’s/DeepSeek’s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s, 10,000 H800s, 30,000 H20s, and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack. SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone (i.e., excluding other data center construction and operating costs).5

In terms of absolute performance DeepSeek’s January 2025 AI models are best understood as being comparable to the best American models available in the summer of 2024. DeepSeek did introduce, however, many improvements related to computational efficiency for both AI training and inference. Some of these were already well understood by American firms but not disclosed publicly, while others were genuinely new innovations. To the general public and media, both types were perceived as new.

While I do believe that DeepSeek should serve as a wakeup call for America, the extent of the media coverage on DeepSeek was out of proportion to its technical achievements. This reflects in part the fact that users of free AI models had not experienced an exposed chain-of-thought reasoning feature, which customers clearly enjoyed, as well as interest in the fact that the model came from China. This helped drive DeepSeek as a major topic of consumer and media interest, which in turn drove the tech stock price drop.

Beyond chip smuggling, the greatest strategic challenge for the United States is the potential for China to produce AI chips domestically at sufficient quantity and quality to build AI data center infrastructure that is competitive with the United States.

DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI. Instead, the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training, as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models.

As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments, it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers. In the case of companies such as Nvidia, their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due to shortages of TSMC production capacity.

The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China’s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity. Most recently, on January 15, the Commerce Department announced the final tranche of Biden administration export controls, often referred to as “the Foundry Rule.” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to a white-list system that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements. However, TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect.

That effectively means that China’s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically. The Biden administration sought to hamstring China’s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including from other countries.

China’s alliance of Huawei (AI chip designer), SMIC (AI chip manufacturer), and CXMT/XMC (high-bandwidth memory manufacturers) have recently made strategically significant progress in advancing domestic production of AI chips.

Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain. The most important links are AI chip design, advanced node logic chip manufacturing, and advanced node high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing.

Like the United States, China has many different companies working on AI chip design, including Huawei, Cambricon, Biren, and more. However, Huawei is unambiguously in the strongest position with its Ascend AI chip product line.

The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC. SMIC’s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips since July 2021, more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration’s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect. SMIC and Huawei are now working to bring a 5 nm node into scaled production but must do so without access to Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment, since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls have prevented such machines from ever being exported to China. Industry sources told me that, in early 2020, ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe, such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process.

In December 2024, industry sources told me that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month (WPM) across both SN1 (which focuses on 14 nm node production) and SN2 (which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production). This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect before Dutch DUV lithography export controls went into effect in mid-2023.

However, the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm (which in SMIC’s node naming system is called “N+2”) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching, deposition, inspection, and metrology. Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis, meaning that it cannot be legally sold anywhere in China. However, other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis. This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others. In some cases, this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer, but not others. In such cases, relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal. But SMIC’s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is already illegal, and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity, particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government.

Industry sources told me that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm. These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei. Government officials told me that in such circumstances, the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status.

According to the sources, SiEn and Pensun, however, did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased, and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs. They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls. The source described this as a “buy everything you can, while you can” strategy.

The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment. Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment, they were amenable to a sale. This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025. The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation.

As a result of the successful in-country equipment transfer, SMIC expects to achieve 50,000 7 nm wafers per month (WPM) by the end of 2025. If all of this capacity was devoted to manufacturing Ascend AI chips that would imply the production of millions of Ascend 910C chips annually. However, SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips. Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones, laptops, data centers, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, SMIC has other customers besides Huawei. Still, the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future.

Huawei’s Ascend chips continue to face challenges in terms of a lack of compatible AI software that is driving low utilization of purchased chips. However, this could change if DeepSeek’s open-source community enthusiasm improves Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem competitiveness with Nvidia’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei’s competitor to CUDA, which Huawei refers to as its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN). For a company like DeepSeek, migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project. The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive, but this could change over the next few years. If it does, it would have major implications for U.S. AI competitiveness both inside and outside of China.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions.

CSIS,"DeepSeek, Huawei, Export Controls, and the Future of the U.S.-China AI Race","Published March 7, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/deepseek-huawei-export-controls-and-future-us-china-ai-race,"Six months ago, few in the West aside from obsessive AI professionals had heard of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI research lab founded barely more than a year and a half ago. Today, DeepSeek is a global sensation attracting the attention of heads of state, global CEOs, top investors, and the general public.

With thereleaseof its R1 model on January 20, 2025—the same day as President Trump’s second inauguration—DeepSeek has cemented itsreputationas the top frontier AI research lab in China and caused a reassessment of assumptions about the landscape of global AI competition. By January 27, DeepSeek’s iPhone app had overtaken OpenAI’s ChatGPT as themost-downloadedfree app on Apple’s U.S. App Store. The stock prices of some U.S. tech companies briefly tumbled, including the AI chip designer Nvidia, which lost more than$600 billionoff its valuation in a single day. (AI chips are also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the terms are used interchangeably in this report.)

ChatGPT has again overtaken DeepSeek in app store rankings, and Nvidia’s stock price hassince mostly recovered. However, investor interest in Chinese tech companies hasgrown significantlyand remains elevated. DeepSeek is now evenreportedlyseeking investment from venture capital firms.

As a sector, AI is prone to overreactions and wild swings in perception. One might think that the story of DeepSeek is just another overblown AI hype cycle. However, the extraordinary attention focused on DeepSeek is justified, even if the conclusions some have drawn from its success are not. It would be a great mistake for U.S. policymakers to ignore DeepSeek or to suggest that its accomplishments are merely a combination of intellectual property theft and misleading Chinese propaganda. Policymakers need to understand that—even while DeepSeek has in some cases simply implemented innovationsalready knownto U.S. AI companies—DeepSeek has also demonstratedgenuine technological breakthroughsof its own. These facts deserve careful consideration as the second Trump administration sets its AI policy agenda.

This paper provides an overview of DeepSeek’s origins and achievements, their geopolitical implications, and the key challenges facing U.S. and allied policymaking as a result. The paper pays particular attention to DeepSeek’s implications for the future of AI and semiconductor export control policy. It concludes that—while DeepSeek’s success does partly reflect failures of earlier implementations of U.S. export controls—these controls can continue to play a critical role in supporting the United States’ strategy for winning the AI race against China. Success is not guaranteed and will require two things:

(1) Preventing large-scale AI chip smuggling and

(2) Preventing the team of Huawei and SMIC from providing a viable Chinese AI chip alternative to the leading incumbent international team of Nvidia and TSMC.

Both will be exceedingly difficult, and in both cases export controls can at best slow and disrupt Chinese efforts, not stop them.

Regarding the second point, Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism. At a meeting on February 17 between Chinese Community Party (CCP) Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives (including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng), Huawei founder Ren ZhengfeitoldXi that hisprevious concernsabout the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. Ren furthersaidthat he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies who are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously. While China’s economy faces many challenges, Gerard DiPippo of RAND is correct toargue,

Even if overall economic growth remains comparatively weak and many Chinese firms continue to struggle, China’s central and local governments will keep supporting high-tech industries and emerging stars like DeepSeek. . . . Western policymakers shouldn’t make the mistake of believing China is down and out, and they shouldn’t be surprised when China continues to catch up or make breakthroughs in critical and emerging technologies.

What follows are a series of 21 key judgments regarding DeepSeek, Huawei, export controls, and the future of U.S.-China AI competition.

Readers are advised to pay special attention to the discussion of Huawei and SMIC, as this report contains a great deal of new and previously private information regarding Huawei’s progress toward indigenizing China’s AI and semiconductor technology stack.

DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund focused on algorithmic trading powered by deep learning. Deep learning is thecore technology paradigmunderlying the past two decades of rapid AI advancements. Cofounded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder and CEO of DeepSeek, High-Flyer was alreadyrankedas the top Chinese hedge fund in 2019.

DeepSeek’s heritage via High-Flyer in the algorithmic trading world helps to explain its success in frontier AI research and especially its success with its most recent model releases. Algorithmic trading firmsfrequently own and operatetheir own data center infrastructure, which they use to develop proprietary investment strategiespowered by machine learning artificial intelligence.

High-Flyer hasadmittedthat its activities include “High-Frequency Trading,” though High-Flyer de-emphasizes this work since it ispolitically controversial(and was for a time banned) in China. High-frequency trading firms race against each other to be the fastest asset traders reacting to new market developments and are obsessively focused on optimizing and accelerating their computing infrastructure. These effortsroutinely includeintense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency. Firms can justify making these expensive investments in computing and network infrastructure optimization because the success or failure of trades collectively worth billions of dollars depends upon reducing the time between learning of a fact and making a stock trade based on that new fact by mere nanoseconds (billionths of a second).

High-Flyer is among the leaders of such firms in China and has long been among the most focused on both AI algorithms for trading and data center engineering. TheFinancial Timesreportedthat, by mid-2022, High-Flyer had already acquired more than 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips (which at the time were the most advanced AI chips in the world) and spent more than 1.2 billion RMB (roughly $180 million at the time) to build two data centers. These infrastructure investments distinguished High-Flyer from most other Chinese companies: Onlyfourother companies in China possessed such a large quantity of chips at the time, and all were major tech companies, not finance companies. In a 2023 interview, Liangsaid:

We always wanted to carry out larger-scale experiments, so we’ve always aimed to deploy as much computational power as possible. . . . We wanted to find a paradigm that can fully describe the entire financial market.

In another 2023interviewwith a Chinese media outlet, Liang provided a timeline for High-Flyer’s AI chip compute reserves as a gradual “progression from one GPU in the beginning, to 100 GPUs in 2015, 1,000 GPUs in 2019.” He stated that, from the day of DeepSeek’s 2023 founding onward, High-Flyer had both the computational power and “ample R&D budgets” to support DeepSeek’s mission of “research and exploration” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

DeepSeek’s heritage from High-Flyer’s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models. More broadly, the synergy of technical skills between the world of algorithmic trading and AI research is well known. For example, industry sources at leading U.S. AI labs told CSIS that they have also focused on recruiting talent, especially compute infrastructure engineers, with experience in the high-frequency trading industry. Both sectorspaysuch talented individuals handsomely.

DeepSeek’s recent technological achievements (reflected in theDeepSeek-V2,DeepSeek-V3,DeepSeek-R1,DeepSeek Math, andNative Sparse Attentiontechnical papers) can most easily be understood through two basic facts:

First, DeepSeek has demonstrated a suite of algorithmic and architectural improvements that significantly reduce the amount of computing power (and therefore financial investment) required for any AI model to reach and operate at a given level of performance. This is true for both the training stage (in which AI models are created) and the inference stage (in which their capabilities are used to serve internal or external customers).

Second, DeepSeek has now developed AI models in China that are broadly comparable to the best U.S.-developed AI models introduced in mid-2024 (e.g.,OpenAI’s o1orAnthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet).

Of the two demonstrations, the fact that these advances came from China is more surprising than the fact that they happened at all. DeepSeek’s improvements in technical performance were consistent withpreexisting trend linesof AI performance improvements. They represent expected performance breakthroughs, not shocking ones.

To understand why, it is helpful to consider an analogy in the form of Moore’s Law.In economic terms, Moore’s Law essentially means that computer chips improve to be roughly twice as good in performance for the same amount of money roughly every two years. Though the nature of that performance improvement has changed, this trend has been consistently observed for almostsix decades(withsome caveats).

As Moore’s Law has been repeatedly validated since the 1960s, it has become steadily easier to confidently predict that computing performance per dollar will continue to double every two years. But, as the fortunes of Intel vividly demonstrate, that is not synonymous with being able to state with confidence which specific company or which specific technical innovations will deliver that improved performance. The same is true of AI today: It is easier to forecast the degree of AI performance growth than to forecast who will invent that performance growth or how.

AI has its own versions of Moore’s Law that aredriving exponential growthin both absolute performance and performance available at a given cost. At a high level, these sources of improvement can be grouped into three types:

Epoch AI, an AI-focused nonprofit research institute, hasestimatedthat, while the amount of human-generated training data will likely plateau in 2028, algorithmic and architectural improvements and increased computing resources have been improving at 3x per year and 4.6x per year respectively—for a combined multiplier effect of 13.8x per year. In short, AI performance is increasing at a rate far faster than the familiar (though still extraordinary) pace of exponential progress described by Moore’s Law. Even ignoring the possible remaining improvements from harvesting additional training data, a (highly oversimplified) back-of-the-envelope estimate of future performance based on the compute trends and algorithmic architectural trends would suggest that AI performance at the end of 2028 will be more than 36,000 times better than at the beginning of 2025, rather than just the four or eight times better that would be true if improvement were only occurring at the familiar pace of Moore’s Law.

For those who only began paying attention to AI with the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, this pace of progress can be both breathtaking and difficult to believe. However, for those familiar with the AI industry’s history over the past two decades, the fact that an AI model that requires a massive data center one year can run on a laptop or a single AI chip afew years lateris well-known as arecurring, though still quite incredible, phenomenon. The dramatic reduction in cost-per-performance DeepSeek demonstrated is not a surprise to Western AI researchers. They have been leaders in driving—and benefitting from—the exact same trend for more than a decade. One might ask: “If that is the case, why are U.S. AI labs still building ever larger and more powerful data centers?” Put simply, such companies are reinvesting all efficiency gains toward improved overall performance. Dario Amodei, CEO of the U.S. AI lab Anthropic, put itthis way:

Because the value of having a more intelligent system is so high, this [reduced cost] shifting of the curve typically causes companies to spendmore, not less, on training models: the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models, limited only by the company’s financial resources.

Moreover, AI researchers are clearly nowhere near the absolute ceiling of computational performance and efficiency. The human brain is a real-world existence proof of human-level intelligence that requiresonly 20 wattsof electricity, compared to the megawatts orgigawattscontemplated for future AI data centers. Despite the manydifferencesbetween human brains and machine intelligence, the existence of the brain hints at future intelligence efficiency possibilities in much the same way that bird wingsinspiredthe Wright brothers.

Thus, it is not at all surprising that somewhere on earth, an AI research lab managed to deliver the improved AI performance-per-dollar that DeepSeek’s technical papers demonstrate. The only surprise is that the research lab that discovered some of the relevant technical innovations is a Chinese one, and notably one whosetechnical teamappears to have beeneducatedand trained almost entirely in China, rather than at Western universities or Western companies.

While Chinese researchers have been at or close toworld classin manydomains of AI researchfor many years, DeepSeek represents thefirst timethat a Chinese AI lab has demonstrated breakthroughs at or near the absolute frontier of foundational AI research. Many of the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated are now the new state-of-the-art. Of note, this is exactly what the Chinese government set as a goal in China’s 2017official AI strategy:

By 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories for AI, such that some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level and AI becomes the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transformation.

In the first week after the publication of DeepSeek’s R1 paper,some commentatorsargued that DeepSeek’s results were fabricated as part of a Chinese propaganda effort or “psyop.” This is simply false. Researchers at U.S. universities havealready reproducedsome of the research results described in the DeepSeek V3 and R1 papers, and U.S. AI firms arealready workingon adapting DeepSeek’s novel techniques to utilize them in their own AI efforts.

As will be discussed further in this paper, essentially all DeepSeek’s technical innovations relate to algorithmic and architectural improvements. DeepSeek did not have superior computing hardware, nor did they have access to uniquely important datasets (excluding synthetic data) that might have provided an advantage over Western researchers. The key technical innovations that DeepSeek demonstrated across theDeepSeek-V2(May 2024),DeepSeek-V3(December 2024),DeepSeek-R1(January 2025), andotherresearch papers are significant. Some of these innovations had already been independently discovered by U.S. firms (and not disclosed publicly), but others were genuinely new.

Manymediaandpolicycommentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China’s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities. There is some merit to aspects of the first claim, but the second is wrong.

To begin, DeepSeek’sV3 research paperstates that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips, which, at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour, equates to $5.576 million.

The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidiaspecifically developedfor the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed onOctober 7, 2022. In particular,those controlsrestricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics: total processing power and interconnect speed.

Government sources told CSIS that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its (at the time) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips. They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100, which was firstintroducedin 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors. Additionally, the U.S. government assumed that, if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other, this would require the typicalmultiyearAI chip development timeline.

What the U.S. government architects of the October 2022 export control policy did not realize, however, was that Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products. Specifically, each Nvidia chip is designed forredundancy, recoverability, and defect toleranceto minimize the impact of manufacturing defects. Such defects are a significant concern in the advanced node semiconductor industry, and designing chips to mitigate their potential impact is near universal. Nvidia can blow one or more strategically placed electrical fuses on the chip so that a manufacturing defect would usually only reduce the chip’s performance or deactivate a redundant component, rather than rendering the entire chip nonfunctional. Industry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidiablew fuseson A100 chips toreduce their interconnect speed(but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines.

In essence, the A100 was born with the capability to become an A800 if needed, via fuse settings. The H800, by contrast, did involve some minor Nvidiare-engineeringand design optimization in the face of export controls. This allowed Nvidia to continue shipping large volumes of advanced AI chips (with performance near the global state of the art)to Chinawithout violating export controls and without taking multiple years to design new chips specifically for the Chinese market. According toreportingbyThe Information, the performance of the A800 and H800 chips was close enough to the performance of the originals that there was effectively no demand for large-scale AI chip smuggling to China during the period in which A800s and H800s were available. Why smuggle when the legally purchased chips are good enough?

The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China’s AI ecosystem. Former government officials told CSIS that this was clear internally by December 2022. However, it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act. The U.S. governmentmodifiedthe export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s, H800s, and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China.

During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal, an enormous number of them were sold to China. Precise sales figures are not available, but Nvidia’s disclosed sales to China between October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023, exceeded 9 billion dollars. This does include revenue for chips that were not widely used in AI training or inference, however. See Table 1 for Nvidia’s quarterly revenue by billing locations.

If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models, it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law, since the H100 has never been legally available in China and cannot even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China. Thus, if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity, it would have an incentive to conceal this fact. This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively.

Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed tostrong evidencethat DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed: Many of DeepSeek’s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth. At a minimum, this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s.

This does not prove, however, that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure. Indeed, somereportingin Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls. The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis, citing anonymous industry sources, recentlywrotethat DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs, a category that includes H100s, H800s, and H20s. SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer’s/DeepSeek’s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s, 10,000 H800s, 30,000 H20s, and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack. SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone (i.e., excluding other data center construction and operating costs).

Nathan Lambert, a machine learning researcher at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, has correctlypointed outthat

Tracking the compute used for a project just off the final pretraining run is a very unhelpful way to estimate actual cost. It’s a very useful measure for understanding the actual utilization of the compute and the efficiency of the underlyinglearning, but assigning a cost to the model based on the market price for the GPUs used for the final run is deceptive.

In this case, it is not DeepSeek that is being deceptive, however, since their paper was extremely clear about what was and was not included in the $5.6 million figure. It was only the final, successful pretraining run. It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run, nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads.

While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023, industry sources told CSIS that, by early 2024, large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway. In mid-2024, journalists atThe Informationinterviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks, each of which provided evidence that they had completed Chinese transactions worth more than $100 million. These networks continue to be active, with increasinglysophisticated techniquesfor evading detection. For example, a December 2024 investigation byThe Informationfound that

When notified of an upcoming inspection, smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they’ve purchased from Supermicro [and already smuggled to China] and attached them to other servers they had access to.

There is some evidence that governments are becoming more serious about cracking down on AI chip smuggling. Singapore was the billing location for 18 percent of Nvidia’s revenue in the most recentlyconcluded fiscal yearbut the shipping location for only 2 percent of revenue. Officials in Singapore recentlyarrestedthree individuals accused of facilitating AI chip smuggling to China. The Singaporean government’s increased emphasis on cracking down on smuggling may reflect itsconcernsabout being relegated to tier 2 status under the Biden administration’sAI Diffusion Framework.

As with the introduction ofHuawei’s Mate60 Pro5G smartphone in August 2023, many commentators were quick to highlight how DeepSeek reflected the failure of U.S. export controls. This included Chinese state-owned media, one outlet of which,GlobalVision,broadcastthat “DeepSeek and Huawei join forces! . . . breaking through U.S. tech restrictions is not impossible!”

Angela Zhang, a professor at the Gould School of Law, went further,arguing:

China’s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation.

This argument is in one sense true: Chinese firms like DeepSeek prioritized innovation in efficiency—and particularly efficiency innovations that are useful given the limitations of the H800—because that was the most attractive AI research path available to them.

However, this argument is deeply flawed for three reasons. First, every leading AI firm, including both U.S. and Chinese ones, is pursuing enhanced efficiency. As mentioned above, DeepSeek’s efficiency improvements represented a continuation of preexisting industry trends in AI computation efficiency improvements, not a drastic acceleration of them. Even before DeepSeek was founded, and even before the U.S. imposed export controls, DeepSeek’s parent company was obsessively focused on improving computing efficiency (though more focused on optimizing latency). It is strange to say that export controls caused AI firms to do something that they—both U.S. and Chinese—were already doing (and already had a massive financial incentive to do) before export controls were imposed.

Second, the argument is flawed because it does not engage with the question of “how much further along might China be in the absence of export controls?” The largest AI computing cluster currently operating on Earth is xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which was recently upgraded to use200,000 H100 chips. Given that leading Chinese firms were alreadyproducing moreAI-related patents, publishing nearly as many highly cited research papers, andspending nearly as muchon data center capital expenditures before the export controls went into effect, it is entirely possible that China would already be ahead of the United States in AI in the absence of export controls. Jimmy Goodrich, a non-resident senior associate at the Wadhwani AI Center, put it well when hesaid, “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.” Goodrich’s statement on DeepSeek applies to China as a whole.

Third, this argument does not take account of the benefits of reallocating the supply of high-performance chips that would otherwise have gone to China. Nvidia, which is estimated to have90 percentglobal market share in AI chips, is supply constrained, not demand constrained. For every Nvidia chip that TSMC has been able to manufacture since 2022, there are many customers willing to buy them. Larry Ellison, the cofounder of Oracle, colorfully described how Nvidia’s customers have to beg for greaterchip allocationin September 2024 when herecounteda dinner between himself, xAI CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang:

I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs, [saying] “Please take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.”

What this means is that, since the AI chip shortage began in 2022, all the chips that Nvidia would have sold to China in the absence of export controls would have come at the expense of customers elsewhere, which in this case is overwhelmingly the United States. In other words, eliminating the export controls would have not only helped China, it would have also hurt the United States, at least in terms of Nvidia chip allocation.

For his part, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng is under no illusions that the chip export controls have helped China or DeepSeek. In a July 2024 interview, hesaid, “We do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must usetwo to four timesthe computing power to achieve the same results, referring to the penalty of using the H800 instead of the H100 for large model training.

Further evidence of the impact of U.S. export controls comes from the fact that DeepSeek experienced widespread outages and had tohalt new user sign-upsin the wake of its massive user adoption growth. While DeepSeek claimed that the outages were the result of cyberattacks, the far more likely explanation is that they simply lacked sufficient computing capacity to serve their growing user base. There is a big difference between the amount of computing power required to serve an AI large language model to a small number of users and doing what OpenAI does, which is serve its AI models to400 million active usersevery week. More recently, DeepSeek hasonce againreopened new user sign-ups, which likely reflects the company successfully purchasing or renting additional computing capacity. Nevertheless, the point remains: Compute capacity matters.

In describing its goals toward creating AGI, a recent DeepSeek job advertisementsaidthat “We believe AGI is the violent beauty of model x data x computing power.” Though a bit oversimplified, that formula is still essentially correct and helps explain why having larger computing resources is a useful advantage at any level of computational efficiency.

All of DeepSeek’s innovations were algorithmic and architectural. DeepSeek appears to have described all or nearly all of them in great detail in its research papers. That means that U.S. AI labs are free to apply these same innovations in training and deploying their own AI models. Indeed, U.S. firms arealready doing so.

But while DeepSeek’s algorithmic innovations are replicable by U.S. firms, DeepSeek will struggle to replicate U.S. AI chip and compute advantages. In theabsenceof extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology, China’s most advanced AI chip designer and logic chip manufacturer, Huawei and SMIC, respectively, will most likely remain stuck at 7 nanometers (nm) or perhaps aflawed 5 nmtechnology node for many years. The CEO of ASML, which is the sole firm in the world manufacturing EUV lithography machines,said“By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West. That really has an effect.”

By contrast, U.S. chip firms such as Nvidia will in coming years press forward past the 4 nm era into the2 nm and beyondfuture, delivering chips that might be thousands or tens of thousands of times better performing integrated into data centers usingtensor hundreds of times more chips. While there are still many ways in which the U.S. government could bungle export control implementation and enforcement—which will be discussed later in this paper—the greatest potential for impacts from the export controls are still well ahead in the future as the United States races forward and China’s progress continues to slow. Implemented properly, they offer the opportunity for a meaningful, though far from permanent, edge over China.

Much of the initialcommentaryon DeepSeek suggested that demand for AI chips might plummet, as efficiency improvements meant that fewer chips were needed to achieve the same level of intelligence. While this is a generally accurate description of efficiency, it is a terrible description of how computing economics works.

As mentioned above, Moore’s Law has driven a more than billionfold improvement in computing efficiency over the past seven decades. Does this mean that all of the world’s computing needs are handled by a single computer that costs only a fraction of a penny? Of course not. Instead, the increased efficiency has made applying digital computation throughout the economy far more attractive, and so more governments, businesses, and consumers have invested in more computation across countless applications and use cases. This is the essence ofJevon’s Paradox, which describes how increasing efficiency can increase aggregate demand.

The same is obviously going to be true of increased AI computational efficiency. Indeed, after the DeepSeek revelations, the largest data center buyers in the world—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon—announcedthat they were going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI chips and data centers, up by nearly 50 percent over the already record amount invested in 2024. Chinese firms such as Alibaba haveannouncedthat they too will make massive chip purchases in the wake of DeepSeek.

Nor is this merely a long-term phenomenon. Even in the short term, rental prices for H100 chips hosted by Amazon’s cloud computingspikedupward in the wake of DeepSeek’s publication as customers worked to incorporate DeepSeek models into their operations. More recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altmansaidthat OpenAI would have to temporarily limit usage of its GPT 4.5 model because the company did not have sufficient GPUs to meet all of the demand.

Moreover, there is almost certainly no “ceiling” for a desirable amount of intelligence and the computing required to power that intelligence. Miles Brundage, who previously led policy research at OpenAI,describedit this way:

To make a human-AI analogy, consider [Albert] Einstein or John von Neumann as the smartest possible person you could fit in a human brain. You would still want more of them. You’d want more copies. That’s basically what inference compute or test-time compute is—copying the smart thing. It’s better to have an hour of Einstein’s time than a minute, and I don’t see why that wouldn’t be true for AI.

This again relates to how the most significant impacts of the export controls are likely in the future, as the evermore extremely scaled deployment of evermore powerful chips begins to bear fruit. It is the next few rounds of increasing AI computation—by tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold—where China will be most severely blocked and the impact of the export controls will be most severely felt.

Some Chinese AI researchers have made similar points. On February 13, 2025, Li Guojie, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering,toldChinese media outletChinaFundthat DeepSeek’s success represents a step-change in Chinese AI capabilities but said that “due to the blockade of the U.S. government, China is currently unable to obtain the most advanced chip process technology.” Li went on tosay[machine translation]:

The success of DeepSeek does not deny the key role of computing power in the development of artificial intelligence. In fact, since there are much more equipment for reasoning than for training, the computing power required for reasoning [aka inference] will become the main requirement in the future. It is very important to improve the efficiency of the model through algorithm optimization. It is our basic choice to take the green development path of saving computing power, but computing power is definitely a necessary condition for solving artificial intelligence problems and cannot be ignored.

On January 29, OpenAItoldtheNew York Timesthat

We know that groups in the P.R.C. are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to replicate advanced U.S. A.I. models. . . . We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.

Distillation is a well-known technique thatallows“the transfer of knowledge from a larger, more complex language model (the ‘teacher’) to a smaller, more efficient version (the ‘student’).” In short, the inputs and outputs from the teacher model are used as very high-quality synthetic training data by the student model. Distillation is utilized by every major U.S. AI lab to offer smaller, more efficient versions of its models that are faster and cheaper to serve to customers. For example, GPT-4o-mini is the distilled version of GPT-4o, and both were made by OpenAI. There are multiple types of distillation, however, and the more advanced types, which AI labs use to distill their own models, require access to the internals of the models.

While a firm distilling its own models is clearly harmless, there is a strategic consideration if one firm can distill another firm’s models, incurring most or all of the benefits of acquiring a highly capable AI model while incurring far fewer of the costs of creating such a model.

In the case of OpenAI and DeepSeek, the distillation evidence appears quite strong: DeepSeek’s initially released models, when asked by users “what model are you?,” willoften respond, “I’m ChatGPT.” DeepSeek’s updated versions of the model, likely modified using fine-tuning techniques, no longer produce such responses, but this does not reduce the strength of the evidence that DeepSeek relied on distillation. Such unauthorized distillation would be a violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, but the law firm Fenwick haswrittenthat “whether remedies against such [a Terms of Service] breach would sufficiently protect teacher-model owner’s IP remains to be determined.”

If OpenAI were to file a lawsuit against DeepSeek, for example, perhaps it would win in U.S. courts. But how would the size of judicial penalties compare to the strategic benefit for DeepSeek as a firm or for China as a country? And the access to judicial remedies is almost certainly limited to the United States and other countries with strong intellectual property protections. Even if DeepSeek were hypothetically clearly guilty of not only distillation but an even more extreme case of outright corporate espionage, Chinese courts would likely find OpenAI guilty of stealing IP from DeepSeek rather than the reverse.

This is what happened to U.S. chipmaker Micron when it accused China’s Fujian Jinhua of stealing memory chip trade secrets and when U.S. prosecutors charged Fujian Jinhua with economic espionage. In retaliation, Jinhua sued Micron in a Chinese court for patent infringement in early 2018. The Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian provincesided with the Chinese sideand issued an injunction blocking Micron from selling 26 chip products in China.

Similarly, when U.S. semiconductor equipment firm Veeco found that a Chinese competitor, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), was using Veeco’s proprietary designs, Veeco secured apreliminary injunctionin a U.S. court to stop a supplier from providing parts to AMEC. However, in response, AMEC filed a patent suit in China, and the Fujian High Court (the same province as above) acted with remarkable speed. On December 7, 2017—just weeks after AMEC’s filing—the court granted AMEC a preliminary injunctionwithout even hearingVeeco’s defense.

Thus, one should separate the questions of what is “fair” or “true” from what the strategic consequences are likely to be. Neither geopolitics nor business is a contest where first prize always goes to the most innovative. Many companies, includingU.S. tech companies, have a perfectly viable business strategy of closely monitoring their innovative competitors and then either buying the competitor or replicating its innovation. Chinese firms can do the same, including in ways that both do and do not violate intellectual property.

Thus, the meaningful strategic question for OpenAI and other U.S. AI firms is not whether DeepSeek is failing to play by the rules, it is whether U.S. firms have a mechanism for effectively preventing DeepSeek or any competitor from extracting the benefits of an AI lab’s investments without bearing the costs. What enduring sources of competitive advantages could the large U.S. AI labs secure if Chinese companies or other copycats (potentially even U.S. ones) can simply piggyback off their work to build cheaper and equivalently good models while incurring only a fraction of the costs?

One possible answer comes in the form of Meta’s strategy, which is to invest in developing open-source AI models justified not by the direct benefits of increasing monthly subscriptions, but by the indirect benefits of enhancing their existing social media and advertising business lines.

Among the worst outcomes for U.S. AI companies would be if the fundamentals of AI research and development were structurally similar to those of the global pharmaceutical industry. In 2023, the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies invested approximately$2.4 billionover10 to 15 yearsinto developing a typical new drug from start to finish. The costs of research and development dwarf those of drug manufacturing, marketing, and distribution, so the final price of the product must reflect the costs of research and development for pharmaceutical firms to have any hope of recovering their investments and earning a profit.

To incentivizedrug R&D, the U.S. government offers companies20-year patentsthat allow them the exclusive right to sell their products in the United States at a monopoly premium to recover upfront R&D costs. However, once a patent expires, so-called generic manufacturers can reproduce and sell the same drug for a far lower price—avoiding the burden of R&D costs altogether. Generic manufacturers can thereafter compete by selling identical drugs while incurring only a tiny fraction of the costs faced by the original drug developer. In a world where there was no patent protection on new pharmaceuticals, investment in new drug discovery (and thus the pace of innovative new drugs)would be radically limitedbecause governments and philanthropic actors might be the only ones willing to invest, and they would almost certainly do so at far lower levels than the current private sector does.

Government and business-makers alike must now ask the question: What if frontier AI model research is structurally identical to that of the pharmaceutical industry, meaning extremely high upfront R&D costs and very low replication costs? The implications for AI investment and for U.S.-China AI competition could be significant.

The U.S.-China AI race is very likely not one in which gentlemanly concepts of “fairness” matter. Chinese companies havesystematicallystolen American IPforyearsand will almost certainly continue to do so. Beyond Chinese firms, the Chinese government has avery clear historyof either not enforcing oroutright supportingChinese firms that illegally violate U.S. patents in cases where the Chinese government has identified the industry as strategically significant. AI certainly falls into that category.

Kai-Fu Lee, arguably the top venture capitalist in China’s AI sector, wrote in his 2018 bookAI Superpowersthat imitation does not have the same stigma in China that it does in the United States. He went further to argue that China’s unabashed willingness to copy innovation and even ignore intellectual property makes its companies more competitive, not less. In describing the post-2010 rise of hypercompetitive and cutthroat Chinese tech firms as “copycat gladiators,” Lee’s writing on this topic is worth quoting at length:

Silicon Valley may have found the copying undignified and the tactics unsavory. In many cases, it was. But it was precisely this widespread cloning—the onslaught of thousands of mimicking competitors—that forced companies to innovate. Survival in the internet coliseum required relentlessly iterating products, controlling costs, executing flawlessly, generating positive PR [public relations], raising money at exaggerated valuations, and seeking ways to build a robust business ‘moat’ to keep the copycats out. Pure copycats never made for great companies, and they couldn’t survive inside this coliseum. But the trial-by-fire competitive landscape created when one is surrounded by ruthless copycats had the result of forging a generation of the most tenacious entrepreneurs on earth. As we enter the age of AI implementation, this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China’s core assets in building a machine-learning-driven economy.

Taking Lee’s argument one step further: If the future global competitive landscape for AI is one of ruthless copying in the absence of robust intellectual property protections, that is an environment where Chinese entrepreneurs ought to do extremely well, because it resembles the domestic Chinese tech ecosystem in which they grew up and thrived.

Even over just the past three years, a diverse set of examples suggests that robustly protecting key knowledge in the AI field is likely to be extremely difficult:

If you know which research dead ends to avoid (e.g., MCTS) and roughly know what research direction to pursue, replication is much easier. These algorithmic insights likely slowly leaked through SF party conversations and other channels. It probably takes a few months once you have the idea for [OpenAI’s reasoning AI model] o1 to replicate it. That’s how DeepSeek did it without much compute.

While there is ongoingresearchintotechniquesto prevent model distillation, and AI companies will no doubt increase these efforts in the wake of DeepSeek, this remains an open question with significant implications. In an interview published inChinaTalk, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodeisaid,

Like all problems in cybersecurity . . . [distillation is] going to be an ongoing issue. That’s why some companies have chosen to kind of hide the chain of thought in their reasoning models, because it makes it much harder to distill. Those can be jailbroken. But folks are working on antidotes to jailbreaking. We just released something today that makes itmuch harder to jailbreak models.

Even in a case where distillation and more explicit cases of technological espionage are difficult or impossible to prevent, however, there will remain the issue inference computation, which involves applying more computational resources so that the model can “think” harder about the answer to a question or so that the model can be used more times and serve more users. One way of thinking about this is that the nature of competitive advantage in AI could be shifting from a secret that one keeps (i.e., themodel weights) toward an asset that one controls (i.e., massive data center compute infrastructure). This means that export controls—if implemented and enforced effectively—still have an opportunity to have a strategic impact.

Nevertheless, the U.S. government and U.S. AI firms need to take a tough look at whether and how they can remain competitive in a world where China does not respect intellectual property and is committed to devoting enormous state resources to technical espionage in the AI and semiconductor sectors.

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency charged with adjudicating license applications and enforcing export controls, not just on semiconductors bound for China, but for all U.S. dual-use technology exports that might end up in Russia, Iran, North Korea, and many other restricted destinations. To implement its work overseeing trillions of dollars in economic activity and policing smuggling operations worldwide, BIS has fewer than 600 employees and a relatively paltry budget of just under $200 million. Semiconductors are just one technology category out of hundreds that this organization is responsible for enforcing.

Reporting byThe Informationfoundat least eight Chinese AI chip–smuggling networks, with each engaging in transactions valued at more than $100 million. More recentreportingby theWall Street Journalsuggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips. China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the BIS export control enforcement barrier. As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission, China has a reasonable expectation of success. BIS needs not only more money, but also more skilled staff, more enforcement agents, and better enabling technology, especially indata analysis.

Moreover, the Department of Commerce needs more help from the rest of the government, in particular the U.S. intelligence community. Declassified Central Intelligence Agencydocumentsshow that the intelligence community was deeply involved in assisting export control enforcement during the Cold War and delivered solid results by doing so. These are capabilities and priorities that have significantly atrophied in the post–Cold War era but urgently need to be restored.

Recent efforts by the Trump administration to reduce government spending risk making a bad situation worse. On February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justicememorandumthat, among many other actions, disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, whichwas“created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” The memo did not provide any explanation for how the duties of the unit would be performed elsewhere in the Department of Justice, which could mean that this will be implemented as a straightforward reduction in U.S. government capacity to enforce export controls.

Of all the choices available, the worst policy choice that the U.S. government could make is to regulate aggressively but with large loopholes and weak enforcement. Such an approach—which fairly describes the approach taken in the first Trump administration and large chunks of the Biden administration—incurs nearly all the costs of an aggressive export control policy but does so without providing any of the possible strategic benefits in terms of slowing Chinese progress in semiconductors and AI.

As described above, the nature of AI geopolitical advantage appears to be moving away from software secrets that are difficult to protect and toward hardware chip and data center assets that are (hopefully) easier to protect. In this sense, DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI. Instead, the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training, as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models.

As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments, it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers. In the case of companies such as Nvidia, their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due toshortagesof TSMC production capacity.

The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China’s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity. Most recently, on January 15, the Commerce Department announced thefinal trancheof Biden administration export controls, often referred to as “the Foundry Rule.” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to awhite-listsystem that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements. However, as discussed below, TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect.

That effectively means that China’s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically. The Biden administration sought to hamstring China’s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including from other countries.

Historically, one of the biggest sources ofcompetitive advantagefor Nvidia has been its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software ecosystem. CUDA makes itmuch easierfor programmers to write massively parallelized software (as all modern AI software is) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa. Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem, which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers. Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers.

DeepSeek stands out among AI model developers because it implemented software changes below the CUDA level. Most AI researchers rely on CUDA, a higher-level programming language for NVIDIA GPUs, because it simplifies the development process. However, CUDA does not allow fine-grained control over GPU operations at the level DeepSeek required. DeepSeek modified software instructions written in a language called PTX (Parallel Thread Execution). By programming directly in PTX, DeepSeek engineers were able to optimize how the GPU handled specific workloads, particularly in managing expert specialization in the Mixture-of-Experts model and improving memory efficiency. This is an “assembly-level” approach to GPU programming—one that is both extremely difficult and (at least historically) rarely attempted. The trade-off, however, was a major increase in performance efficiency, particularly for large-scale AI training tasks.

This suggests that DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei’s competitor to CUDA, which Huaweirefers toas its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN). The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive, but thiscould changeover the next few years. If it does, it would have major implications for Nvidia’s competitiveness both inside and outside of China.

At present, the combination of Ascend chips (discussed more below) and CANN software appears far from being competitive to CUDA. AFinancial Timesreport from September 2024foundthat even Huawei employees found the product “difficult and unstable to use” and prone to crashing frequently. Industry sources told CSIS that DeepSeek’s more recent evaluation of CANN was very negative and that DeepSeek assessed that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative.

Still, this could change with time, effort, and investment. Huawei recentlyjoinedthe open-source PyTorch foundation in an effort to increase Ascend and CANN compatibility of the PyTorch AI development framework.

There is at least one meaningful precedent regarding the difficulty of leaving the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem, which is Google’s shift from TensorFlow on Nvidia GPUs to JAX on their proprietary chips, called TPUs. In this case, it took several years for JAX to mature and for a critical mass of software libraries to appear—even with heavy Google investment and the payoff opportunity in terms of both efficiency and competitive differentiation. Even by 2023, Google was still heavily investing toimproveJAX (for example, addressing pain points like multi-host setup and memory efficiency) and encouraging its use through education (tutorials, conference workshops). For a company like DeepSeek, migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project. Google’s internal shift took 2–3 years to bear significant fruit, and even then Google maintained support for both for a long while.

Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain. The most important links are AI chip design, advanced node logic chip manufacturing, and advanced node high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing. Each of these will be addressed in turn.

Like the United States, China has many different companies working on AI chip design, including Huawei, Cambricon, Biren, and more. However, Huawei is unambiguously in thestrongest positionwith its Ascend AI chip product line. Industry sources also told CSIS that Huawei—due to its highly influential position with the Chinese government and its size as a customer—has the greatest leverage over SMIC. In other words, even if Huawei were not the best AI chip designer in China, it would still be the most important since it is in a position to restrict the share of SMIC manufacturing capacity that goes toward its domestic competitors.

Huawei has been a player in the AI chip market for longer than is generally realized. Huawei had a 7 nm AI Accelerator chip planned for production at TSMCin 2020. At the time, Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called3-5-2 policy, in which the CCP’s Central Office ordered all government agencies andmany state-owned enterprisesto eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years. However, Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration’s updated2020 entity listing, which temporarily cut Huawei’s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC. In this instance, Nvidia was the beneficiary of these early U.S. export controls, which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI chip technology.

Today, Huawei’s Ascend product line is focused on the Ascend 910B and the Ascend 910C, the latter of which includes two Ascend 910B logic dies per integrated unit (meaning more real estate on each silicon wafer is required for manufacturing an Ascend 910C than a 910B). DeepSeek hasreportedlyevaluated the Ascend chips and found that they are unattractive for training AI models but that each Ascend 910C delivers roughly 60 percent of the performance of an Nvidia H100 for inferencing AI models. This matters greatly since more and more of the computing requirements for advanced AI models are expected to be devoted to inference in the coming years. Barclays, an investment bank,estimatesthat by 2026, 70 percent of AI compute demand will come from inference. In February 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangestimatedthat utilization of its chips was “40 percent inference, 60 percent training,” compared to 90 percent training-focused in the 2016 timeframe.

Chinese firms like Huawei have historically had two major options for manufacturing their AI chip designs: outsource production abroad to TSMC of Taiwan or produce chips domestically in partnership with SMIC.

For a time, it seemed as though the 2020 entity listing of Huawei definitively cut the company off from accessing TSMC advanced node manufacturing capacity. TheOctober 2022andOctober 2023export controls were supposed to have done the same for all advanced node AI chip designers in China.

However, TSMC manufactured large quantities of Huawei Ascend 910B chips on behalf ofHuawei shell companiesand shipped the chips to China in violation of U.S. export controls. In an interview with theNew York Times, an unnamed Taiwanese officialacknowledgedthat these chips “ended up in the hands of Huawei.” Government officials told CSIS that TSMC manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei. If true, this is enough dies to make 1 million Ascend 910C units. However, the advanced packaging process by which two Ascend 910B dies and HBM arecombinedinto a unified Ascend 910C chip alsointroduces defectsthat can compromise the functionality of the chip. Industry sources told CSIS that roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process.

This is a strategically significant stockpile of AI chips. For comparison, Nvidiareportedlyshipped 1 million H20 chips (which areinference specializedand targeted at the Chinese market) to China in 2024. Nvidia’s January 26 SEC filing states that it generated $17 billion in revenues from Chinese customers in the most recently ended fiscal year (which would obviously exclude revenues from chips later smuggled to China). Presumably, the vast majority of these revenues are from H20 sales.

Even though Huawei likely has the more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies made by TSMC, there is a question as to whether it has enough HBM to integrate with those dies in manufacturing 1 million Ascend 910Cs. It seems likely that Huawei does, however, since the U.S. plan to restrict all advanced HBM sales to China on a country-wide basis was leaked to Bloomberg inAugust 2024and did not go into effect untilDecemberof that year, giving Huawei ample time to legally acquire HBM chips as part of a stockpiling strategy. Industry sources told CSIS that Huawei has stockpiled enough HBM to meet their internal expectations for at least a full year’s worth of production, mostly in the form ofpurchases from Samsungof South Korea, potentially via shell companies, that occurred before the December controls went into effect.

It is as though the U.S. government was having an internal debate about whether or not to have a surprise attack, and in the spirit of compromise, the slow interagency process settled on attacking without the surprise. This was an egregious failure with strategic consequences.

With the adoption of theFoundry Rule, it will hopefully be impossible for Huawei or other Chinese AI chip designers to ever again access TSMC manufacturing capacity, even when using sophisticated shell company tactics. Huawei will instead be restricted to what Chinese domestic logic chip manufacturers can produce.

However, there is also the potential risk that an existing chip design company on the Foundry Rule white list could be tempted by massive revenue opportunities to act as a pass-through to give Huawei access to TSMC. Guarding against this risk will require making clear to TSMC that the negative consequences of continuing to supply Huawei with advanced AI chips would be colossal compared to the revenue and profit opportunity. Similarly, Huawei may attempt similar tactics with other chip foundries such as Samsung or even Intel.

The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC. SMIC’s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips sinceJuly 2021, more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration’s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect. SMIC and Huawei are now working tobring a 5 nm nodeinto scaled production but must do so without access to EUV lithography equipment, since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls havepreventedsuch machines from ever being exported to China. Industry sources told CSIS that, in early 2020, ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe, such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process.

In December 2024, industry sources told CSIS that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month (WPM) across both SN1 (which focuses on 14 nm node production) and SN2 (which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production). This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect beforeDutch DUV lithography export controlswent into effect in mid-2023.

However, the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm (which in SMIC’s node naming system is called “N+2”) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching, deposition, inspection, and metrology. The shortage of inspection and metrology tools has also been an important factor preventing SMIC from improving its yield. SMIC acquired lithography equipment as a stockpiling measure in anticipation of future export controls by the Dutch government.

Low production rate also has an impact on yield, since manufacturing technicians and engineers tend to improve their techniques based on experimentation and observed results from production. Thus, more production is helpful in accelerating the pace of learning and thus improving the yield.

Based on the Ascend 910B die size of 665.61 mm², CSIS estimates that each 300-millimeter diameter silicon wafer produces roughly 80 chip dies. This is simply counting the number of small rectangles (chip dies) that can fit inside the large circle (the wafer). A source told CSIS that of these 80 chip dies:

SMIC’s 20 percent yield when producing Ascend 910Bs is quite low, but it is not as low as it might seem. In 2020, when Nvidia moved its GPU production to TSMC’s 7 nm process, the defect-free yield rate wasroughly 41.5 percent. Since manufacturing defects occur randomly on a defects per square centimeter of chip area basis, larger chips (such as AI chips) are more susceptible than smaller chips (such as smartphone application processors) to a high defect rate. Using TSMC during roughly the same time period and with roughly the same defect rate, Apple’s A12 processor enjoyed 90 percent+ yield. SMIC also makes the application processor for Huawei’s Mate smartphone line, and its yield when making these smaller chips is somewhere in the 50–70 percent range.

However, a February 24, 2025reportby theFinancial Times, citing two anonymous individuals, claims that SMIC’s AI chip yield has increased to roughly 40 percent. Industry sources told CSIS that theFinancial Timesreport is not correct and that Huawei/SMIC’s true yield remains at 20 percent. One explanation for the discrepancy would be if theFinancial Times’sources were mistakenly including both the fully functional chips and the chips that are functional but with degraded performance when estimating yield.

As mentioned above, SMIC’s shortage of deposition, etching, inspection, and metrology semiconductor manufacturing equipment also been an important factor preventing expanded production capacity of its SN2 facility. Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis, meaning that it cannot be legally sold anywhere in China. However, other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis. This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others. In some cases, this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer, but not others. In such cases, relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal. But SMIC’s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is alreadyillegal, and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity, particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government.

Industry sources told CSIS that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm. These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei. Government officials told CSIS that in such circumstances, the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status.

According to the sources, SiEn and Pensun, however, did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased, and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs. They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls. The source described this as a “buy everything you can, while you can” strategy.

The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment. Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment, they were amenable to a sale. This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025. The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation.

This equipment will eliminate the near-term U.S. equipment bottleneck facing SMIC for SN2 7 nm production. SMIC’s new 7 nm production bottleneck is the overall size of the facility. Prior public statements from SMIC indicated that the SN1 and SN2 facilities combined have a maximum capacity of 85,000 WPM and that SMIC intended to split production evenly between the two facilities, implying SMIC was targeting ~42,500 WPM of lithography capacity at SN2. Sources told CSIS that SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025. It is unclear whether this means that 7 nm production will now also take place at SN1 or whether SMIC has figured out a production process and equipment configuration that allows them to squeeze more production capacity than expected into SN2. If, hypothetically, SMIC were to devote all 50,000 WPM to Ascend 910C manufacturing, this would imply producing 4 million Ascend 910B dies per month, of which 800,000 would be fully functional. 800,000 910B Ascend dies is enough to manufacture 400,000 910C chips, though the advanced packaging process would reduce yield further, and it is unclear how much HBM Huawei has on hand.

SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips. Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones, laptops, data centers, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, SMIC has other customers besides Huawei. Still, the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future.

Over time, SMIC’s 7 nm yield will likely improve significantly above 20 percent due to the additional equipment and the increased production rate. It will likely not match the best TSMC 7 nm yields for AI chips, however, since TSMC’s best 7 nm yields used EUV, and China has no credible near-term path for acquiring EUV technology.

Over the mid and long term, however, Huawei is working aggressively to produce a domestic alternative to ASML EUV technology. Huawei currently has two semiconductor manufacturing equipment tool research facilities, one in Shanghai and one in Shenzhen. According to areportby Nikkei Asia, Huawei is investing $1.66 billion in the Shanghai facility alone and has hired a large number of chip industry veterans with experience working at companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, ASML, TSMC, Intel, and Micron.

Taylor Ogan, a venture capitalist based in Shenzhen, China, focused on investing in Chinese technology companies,describedHuawei’s EUV efforts as follows:

There are teams at Huawei in two different parts of China that are working around the clock. . . . They are literally cut off from their friends and family just because the work they are doing is so sensitive, and imagine how quickly they’re going to accelerate Chinese complete domestic chip development. . . . One of them is in Shenzhen. That’s the bigger [EUV lithography] breakthrough lab, and you can look on Google Earth. There was nothing there and now there is something there, and there are thousands of people working there. The other one is around Shanghai and that is more for the next chips in the next phones. So, yeah, the bigger lithography breakthroughs are [being worked on] in Shenzhen. . . . They’re working their asses off. . . . This is like some of the smartest people in the space, and they’re all Chinese.

As mentioned above, these secretive efforts underway at Huawei are extremely likely to be benefitting from state-backed industrial espionage, including thecyberattacks on ASMLand itspartners.

A high-quality recentanalysisby Nicholas Welch, Lily Ottinger, and Jordan Schneider ofChinaTalkconcludes that China’s current compute shortage has more to do with practical challenges and suboptimal deployment—many idle small and medium data centers rather than fewer fully-utilized superclusters—than it does with an absolute shortage of chips. A combination of recent Chinese government policy changes,such as“hand[ing] over their idle computing resources to cloud providers” and strategic moves by China’s largest tech companies to favor DeepSeek models even over their in-house ones, suggests that this could change in the near future.

According toreportingbyCaijing Magazine, the chips in China most likely to be underutilized are Huawei’s Ascends, which have benefitted in terms of government pressure to buy domestic but remain underutilized because of a lack of useful AI models that are Ascend-compatible. This could change if DeepSeek adapts its models to run on Ascends, which it is reportedlyworking towardfor model inference, though not model training.

As mentioned above, sources told CSIS that TSMC has supplied Huawei with enough chip dies to manufacture a million Ascend 910C chips, each of which has roughly 60 percent the performance of an Nvidia H100 when used for inference. With the help of Huawei and the Chinese government, DeepSeek could plausibly succeed in driving a reallocation of the Nvidia H800s and H100s already in China toward itself for construction of a new AI model training data center. This could then be augmented by an additional, much larger cluster of Huawei Ascend 910Cs (or Nvidia H20s) to be used for AI model inference. Such a combination is a plausible, perhaps even likely, path for China to continue making significant progress in its AI development.

As discussed above, a million-chip cluster of Huawei Ascends would face the challenge of a shortage of AI models, software, and developer tools that are compatible with Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem. A second challenge is in integrating all of the chips as part of a single cluster where the whole is more than the sum of the parts.Financial Timesreporter Eleanor Olcott interviewed one Beijing-based chip investor whosaid“The bottleneck at the moment isn’t getting the chips but figuring out how to make them work in a cluster. This is really complicated work.” Evidently the true attractiveness of the Huawei Ascend 910C chips is worse than the “60 percent of H100” figure might suggest.

As discussed above, in the absence of export controls, it is plausible that Chinese firms would have already surpassed their U.S. competitors in developing and deploying frontier AI models. It is likewise plausible that China might have already succeeded in driving widespread adoption of the Huawei Ascend chips, just as Huawei’s smartphone division, bolstered by internal chip designs, was looking poised to overtake Apple’s iPhone in China prior to the introduction of effective export controls in 2020. The export controls have done much to slow and complicate China’s technological rise and march toward their longstanding objective of technological self-sufficiency. They are still having a significant effect even now and are poised to have even greater impact in the future as U.S. firms benefit from Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips and as China likely remains stuck at the 7 nm technology node until and unless they develop a domestic EUV lithography capability.

However, China’s successes in substantial government investment, chip smuggling, exploiting gaps in U.S. export control coverage, completing in-country transfers of equipment, hiring talent with experience from leading international firms, reverse-engineering foreign technology, harnessing state-backed economic espionage, and producing genuine domestic innovation are a formidable combination. U.S. firms, working at maximum effort and with the benefit of all their own advantages, will still likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence. This should not, however, be taken for granted.

At a meeting on February 17 between CCP Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives, including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng, Huawei founder Ren ZhengfeitoldXi that hisprevious concernsabout the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. It is possible that he is referring to the aforementioned domestic equipment transfer to SMIC’s facility. Ren furthersaidthat he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies that are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously and have enormous strategic implications beyond just the AI sector.

However, for AI, the key question remains the one that Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has succinctlyposed: “whether China will also be able to get millions of chips.”

China’s success to date suggests that, at least for Huawei Ascend chips, the answer is that they will have millions of chips within the next year or two. Thankfully, these chips are, at present, dramatically lower performing than Nvidia ones for training advanced AI models; they are also supported by a much weaker software ecosystem with many complex issues that will likely take years to sort out. This is the time that the export controls have bought for the United States to win therace to AGIand then use that victory to try and build more durable strategic advantages. At this point, all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed. There is no more time to waste.

CSIS,The Hidden Risk of Rising U.S.-PRC Tensions: Export Control Symbiosis,"Published April 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/hidden-risk-rising-us-prc-tensions-export-control-symbiosis,"As the People’s Republic of China (PRC) retaliates to U.S. tariffs, it has not stopped at imposing its own taxes on imports of American products, which now stand at 125 percent for all U.S. goods. The PRC has alsotightenedexport controls on seven additional critical minerals,added28 U.S. companies to the export control list and 17 to theunreliable entity list, and instituted licensing requirements for seven additional critical minerals. At China’s export control work conference, China’s Ministry of Commerceindicatedthat they would “improv[e] the modern national export control system . . . by improving laws and regulations, strengthening management of listed items, enhancing licensing law enforcement, increasing multilateral and bilateral export control dialogues and exchanges, and promoting compliance.”

These actions are not simply short-term responses to U.S. efforts to strain the Chinese economy. Instead, they are a part of a larger shift in both U.S. and PRC policy toward using restrictions on exports as a tool of weaponized economic interdependence.

In recent years, China has increasingly wielded export controls as a strategic response to U.S. economic measures. Since Huawei and HiSilicon were put on the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List in December 2019, U.S. policy has prioritized the identification and exploitation of China’s economic chokepoints—often without fully anticipating the potential for Chinese retaliation. As a result, China is strategically building the tools to exert economic influence in ways that mirror U.S. strategies. As the United States considers future controls, it should carefully assess the risks to itself and its partners of a China increasingly willing and able to proactively leverage its own export controls against U.S. interests.

Utilizing the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ mapping of U.S. and Chinese export control evolutions, the chart below features four case studies spanning from August 2020 to February 2025. These examples provide strong evidence that China’s export control regime has largely evolved in direct response to U.S. measures, particularly the addition of Chinese firms to the Entity List, the enforcement of the foreign direct product rule, and the restriction of semiconductor sales to Chinese end-users.

In addition to the reactive nature of China’s export control regime, these case studies glean several other takeaways:

As the Trump administration looks to push on China’s economic chokepoints, it should carefully consider the ramifications of doing so. Both Washington and Beijing have asymmetric capabilities, and the United States has its own vulnerabilities which China can leverage. Even with artificial intelligence development—which has been the nucleus of U.S. export controls thus far—China has significant advantages. China benefits from its high-volume production of transformers, which are required for data centers, and from its market share of antimony, gallium, germanium, and indium, critical minerals necessary for semiconductors. These reciprocal dependencies should be a key factor as the United States conceives future export control strategies.

On a structural level, the expansion of U.S. export controls could result in China utilizing its nascent export control regime more proactively. Thus far, the United States has averted such a tripwire, but that would be stressed if Washington tries to cut Beijing off of U.S. legacy chips. In such a scenario, global trade would be reshuffled with both the United States and China rearranging global supply chains. Moreover, if Beijing were to proactively apply their controls, Washington would be caught on the backfoot, with limited ability for recourse.

To safeguard American economic interests while minimizing unnecessary escalation, the following actions should be considered:

Since President Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” on April 2, the United States and China have been inching toward an economic decoupling. Tit-for-tat responses have made way for targeted non-tariff rebuffs, including export controls. Disentanglement would ripple throughout third markets, leaving no countries unaffected. Despite the scale of this challenge, the offramps are shrinking and the tools of escalation are becoming more sophisticated.

As economic security takes center stage in both U.S. and Chinese foreign policies, the United States must navigate this evolving landscape with strategic foresight. A reactive approach risks deepening a cycle of retaliation that could disrupt global markets and weaken U.S. economic resilience. By incorporating a more nuanced assessment of vulnerabilities, maintaining open channels of communication, and preparing for shifts in Beijing’s legal system and regulatory strategies, Washington can craft a more balanced and effective export control strategy that safeguards national interests while avoiding unnecessary economic fallout.

CSIS,The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China Challenge,"Published April 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge,"The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakthrough technologies capable of leapfrogging the current state of the art, potentially destabilizing the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.

In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed controls on the export of designated types of semiconductors, some computer systems and assemblies containing those devices, and equipment used to fabricate those devices to China and to certain named Chinese “entities.” The stated purpose of the controlswasto limit China’s ability to obtain semiconductor manufacturing capabilities to produce ICs (packaged or unpackaged) for uses that are contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.” As detailed in areportby CSIS’s Greg Allen, the administration had several strategic goals:

The October 2022 controls weretightenedin October 2023 and December 2024. Following a major diplomatic effort, similar export controls were implemented by U.S. allies, limiting chip product and technology transfers to China. In March 2025, the Trump administrationimposedadditional chip export restrictions, blacklisting dozens of Chinese entities from trade in semiconductors and other advanced strategic technologies. In the immediate aftermath of the first rounds of chip export controls, it was evident that they were having a number of effects:

While the controls have had an impact, it has also become apparent that export controls cannot halt all exports of chip technology. Restrictions are potentially effective with respect to chipmaking equipment—which is commonly produced in small lots, is heavy, and is technically challenging to transport, install, and maintain. But semiconductor chips are produced by the millions and are small and easily concealed, and design software can very likely be moved across borders undetected. Chinese enterprises have already proven adept at smuggling proscribed chips through various forms of subterfuge.

These incidents, which came to light through happenstance, suggest the existence of larger traffic in smuggled high-end devices. In 2024, theNew York Timesreportedon an active trade in China in controlled AI technology, noting that in a “bustling market in Shenzhen . . . chip vendors reported engaging in sales involving hundreds or thousands of restricted chips.”

More importantly than smuggling, China is responding to U.S. and allied export controls with a whole-of-nation effort to make China independent of Western semiconductor technology. China has already demonstrated that export controls will not impede its capacity to innovate over the longer term. In 2019, the first Trump administration cut off Huawei’s access to U.S. technology, including semiconductors, a move that appeared to consign the Chinese telecommunications giant to irreversible decline. Instead, Huawei launched an effort to wean itself from reliance on U.S. technology, which has made rapid strides:

China’s drive for self-sufficiency in semiconductors is by no means limited to major players like Huawei and SMIC; it extends to previously little-known companies:

Until recently, the Chinese government has focused the bulk of its resources on supporting the chip manufacturing sector, assuming continued access to Western technology. To counter the current U.S. policy, it is now committing massive resources to the promotion of indigenous semiconductor research. China has already made significant progress. At present, itis producingtwice as many research papers as the United States on chip design and production, according to the Emerging Technology Observatory at Georgetown University. These efforts are destined to grow, insofar as China sees this competition as a struggle for national dominance, while the U.S. debates whether its companiesmeritsupport in the global “market” for advanced semiconductor development and manufacture.

The recent Chinese advances underscore a basic limitation in current U.S. policy. Export controls are relevant only so long as the United States and its allies possess chip technologies that China wants and needs. But it is rapidly becoming evident that Chinese firms do not necessarily require access to the most advanced Western technologies to achieve comparable chip competencies via new research or simply “workarounds.” The latter may not be as efficient—or as profitable—but they will enable competitive, “nearly as good” products able to meet Chinese needs while capturing market share and the revenue it entails to fund further investment.

Currently, Chinese engineers are undertaking novel approaches to chip design and production, which in some instances may well yield breakthroughs that both surprise and potentially destabilize the U.S. and allied chip industries:

These accomplishments highlight the need to monitor and assess the progress of China’s industry and the supportive policies and financial support for the industry. More information is needed,giventhat the scale, duration, and diversity of China’s efforts in this critical technology are not fully appreciated by U.S. policymakers.

Some U.S. policymakers may well view current chip export control policies through the lens of the largely successful effort to limit the flow of sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union during the Cold War competition. But that analogy simply does not hold. Many of the technologies at issue in the Cold War were usually physically large—for example, aircraft engines, discrete, and slow to evolve—the opposite of today’s semiconductors. Moreover, at the time, U.S. trade with the Soviet Unionwas largely limitedto U.S. exports of grain, a factor which greatly facilitated the enforcement of controls on technology exports. Supply chains have become so intertwined since the United Statesextendedpermanent normal trade relations to China in 1992 that it is often difficult to discern national boundaries, vastly complicating any effort to limit the flow of technology. Before, China displayed weak, if not backward, innovation capabilities, even for copying U.S. advances in information technologies. Now, China has become an innovation juggernaut in information technology and many other related sectors.

Western chip export controls have had some success in that they briefly set back China’s developmental efforts in semiconductors, albeit at some cost to the United States and allied firms. But current trends underscore that they are at best a short-term palliative for the long-term strategic challenge posed by China in this key sector. The United States and its allies can only address that challenge successfully through comprehensive support for their own chip industries, support that may well exceed the normal parameters of U.S. policy. The unprecedented chips legislation recently enacted in the United States and European Union is part of the response, but far more is needed, particularly expanded public investments in relevant semiconductor research to keep and develop a strong pipeline of well-trained engineers while supporting Western chip firms’ efforts to remain at the technological cutting edge. In the United States, a positive step is the newly formed National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology, which will be crucial to such an effort, promoting industry-government research and development via the National Semiconductor Technology Center. This effort and related programs will need substantial and sustained public support if the United States and its allies are to successfully meet this global challenge. It is a challenge the United States must meet.

CSIS,Understanding U.S. Allies’ Current Legal Authority to Implement AI and Semiconductor Export Controls,"Published March 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-us-allies-current-legal-authority-implement-ai-and-semiconductor-export,"Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it releasedtwo rulesthat added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued theAI Diffusion Frameworkand theFoundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, whichdirectedan effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology . . . to strategic rivals and their proxies” on its first day in office.

However, countries like the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan continue to control key chokepoints in the AI and semiconductor value chain, making unilateral action only so effective. Furthermore, the existing multilateral export control architecture is neither sufficiently flexible nor fast to allow for the kind of sophisticated, targeted controls that the United States has levied on China. The success or failure of the U.S. export control strategy is thus dependent on its allies’ ability to implement controls outside of this traditional architecture or U.S. extraterritorial regulations covering allies.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. allies’ export control authorities related to AI and semiconductor technologies and does the same analysis for China. It demonstrates that U.S. allies often do not have equivalents to U.S. export control authorities and tools like the FDPR and Entity List, but that they generally do have the capability to introduce some controls on advanced semiconductor chips and related equipment not covered by multilateral export control regimes. As a result, lack of alignment with the U.S. export control regime cannot necessarily be attributed to a lack of authorities alone. Allies’ enforcement capacity and willingness to act are also key ingredients in the implementation of effective export controls and are crucial to the success of U.S. and allied technology competition with China. Accordingly, the recommendations section of this paper addresses each of these three elements.

The paper proceeds as follows. First, it identifies key export control authorities used by the United States to slow the progress of China’s AI and semiconductor industries and analyzes which other countries possess these authorities and are thus capable of implementing similar controls. It then surveys the export control policies of key actors, including the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. It concludes by offering recommendations to U.S. and allied policymakers to make AI and semiconductor export controls more effective.

In December 2023, then–Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo clearlyoutlinedthe U.S. strategy for China and its AI ecosystem when she said, “America leads the world in artificial intelligence. America leads the world in advanced semiconductor design, period. . . . We’re a couple years ahead of China. No way are we going to let them catch up.” To achieve this goal, the U.S. national security enterprise has undertaken a massive, multifaceted effort tochoke offChina’s access to cutting-edge AI and related technologies.

Export controls on thehigh-performance semiconductorsused totrain and inferencestate-of-the-art AI models have been at the forefront of this effort so far. On October 7, 2022, the United States enacted a comprehensive set of export controls on advanced semiconductor technologies. Although these controls marked thereversalof nearly 30 years of trade policy, they did not achieve all of their intended goals. U.S. chip designers like Nvidiacontinuedto provide Chinese customers with slightly lower-performance chips, which according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), provided “nearly comparable AI model training capability.” In October 2023, the United Statesupdatedthese controls to cover a much larger set of chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). As noted in aprevious CSIS report, “The United States is firmly focused on retaining control over so-called ‘chokepoint’ . . . technologies in the global semiconductor technology supply chain.” The United States issued major export control updates in December 2024 and January 2025 that continued in this vein.

Despite the significant resources successive administrations have devoted to restricting China’s access to AI and semiconductor technologies, China’s AI ecosystem remains competitive with the United States’. In May 2024, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released a best-in-class open-weight model reportedlytrainedon Nvidia A100 chips stockpiled before the October 2022 controls went into effect. The even more impressive Deepseek-R1 reasoning model wastrainedon Nvidia H800 chips, which were notrestrictedbefore October 2023. The performance of DeepSeek-R1 was so far beyond what the financial analyst community had expected a Chinese firm to be capable of that the tech-heavy Nasdaqdropped3.1 percent in one day as a result of its release. Thisprevious CSIS paperprovides an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek and its implications for U.S. export controls.

At the core of the U.S. chip war strategy is a group of iteratively developed and highly sophisticated export control tools. Authorities granted in theExport Control Reform Act of 2018(ECRA),Export Administration Regulations(EAR), andexecutive ordersoffer the U.S national security community a range of options to control the export, reexport, transit, or transfer of select military, dual-use, and purely commercial items and technologies. In the House Committee on Foreign Affairs markup of ECRA, then–committee chairman Congressman Edward Roycestatedthat ECRA “closes gaps in our export controls that could permit transfers of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors to potential adversaries such as Beijing.” More accurately, ECRA represented the codification of U.S. export control powers that had previously relied onauthoritiesin the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and had anovel focus on emerging technologies.

The U.S. export control regime divides the responsibilities for administering and enforcing export controls on dual-use and military goods and technologies. The Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the flow of dual-use technologies and less sensitive military items, which covers advanced semiconductors and related technologies, through the BIS. Meanwhile, theDirectorate of Defense Trade Controls(DDTC) within the U.S. Department of State oversees and licenses weapons and munitions that are covered by theInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations(ITAR).The Office of Foreign Assets Control(OFAC) at the Treasury Department oversees restrictions on exports based on financialsanctions.

The four kinds of U.S. export controls most relevant to theTrumpand Biden administrations’ efforts to choke off China’s access to AI are described below.

In addition to these four export control types, there are three further export control features that require explanation to understand U.S. AI and semiconductor export controls.

The United States has also employed a range of other economic security tools to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductor technologies. For example, in August 2023 the Biden administration used IEEPA to issue an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department toestablish a programto review outbound investments in national critical sectors such as AI and semiconductors. This measurefollowedreporting that U.S. firms were investing in Chinese AI companies that were on the Entity List. On October 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Departmentissuedits final rule on the implementation of the executive order, which went into effect on January 2, 2025, but is now subject to review as a result of the Trump administration’sAmerica First Trade Policy memorandum.

However vigorously the United States pursues its own export control strategy, it will be unable to achieve success without changing the behavior of other countries. While the United States holds astrong positionin certain parts of the semiconductor value chain like chip design, other countries such as the Netherlands and Japan also play crucial roles in areas like SME. For example, Dutch company ASML is thesole providerof the latest generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines needed to make cutting-edge AI chips. The consulting firm Accentureestimatedthat the inputs to a typical semiconductor chip “could cross international borders approximately 70 or more times before finally making it to the end customer.” In other words, the United States does not control all the relevant chokepoints required to execute its export control strategy. In comments after the October 2022 controls went into effect, one U.S. officialtoldReuters, “We recognize that the unilateral controls that we are putting in place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don’t join us.” At the December 2024 Reagan National Defense Forum, Gina Raimondo reiterated this sentiment, albeit more forcefully,saying, “When I set the rules, I have to make damn sure China can’t just buy this stuff from Japan or Korea or the Europeans, so that’s why we have to work with them.”

Fully aware of this reality, Chinese officials have repeatedly threatened countries considering going along with the U.S. controls. For example, in a March 2022 interview, Tan Jian, China’s ambassador to the Netherlands,said, “This will not be without consequences. I’m not going to speculate on countermeasures, but China won’t just swallow this,” in response to the Netherlands’s increasing alignment with the United States on export controls.1

Unfortunately, U.S. allies have not kept pace with the United States’ increasingly restrictive export controls vis-à-vis China. While the U.S. export control system is designed to be able to keep up with technological developments and to be responsive to changing geopolitical circumstances, the regimes of its allies are generally not. As noted in the previous section, other countries with significant semiconductor industries have export control systemsgroundedin multilateral agreements primarily focused on WMD nonproliferation. These arrangements are significantly less agile than the U.S. system. For example, to add items to a Wassenaar Arrangement control listrequiresconsensus from all participating countries, and opportunities for additions typically occur only once per year. As Wassenaar also includes Russia, which has obstructionist geopolitical goals, findingconsensuson issues with geopolitical implications is unfeasible. In total, it can take up tothree yearsto add a new item to Wassenaar control lists, even under favorable circumstances. Furthermore, Wassenaar explicitly prohibits controls targeting an individual country,notingin its founding document: “This arrangement will not be directed against any state or group of states.” Limited improvements have been made to export control coordination between U.S. allies, such as the informal “Wassenaar minus one” approach, an effort by like-minded countries to harmonize controls on items and technologies not listed in traditional multilateral agreements.

But the existing multilateral export control architecture remains inadequate for U.S. national security requirements. As a result, understanding allied countries’ unilateral export control authorities is crucial to the success or failure of the U.S. and allied technology competition with China.

Allied countries possess significantly less comprehensive export control authorities than the United States. For the most part, they do not have an equivalent to key parts of the U.S. AI and semiconductor export control tool kit discussed in the previous sections like the FDPR, U.S. Persons Rule, Entity List, and restrictions that apply on a country-wide basis. This stands in radical contrast to China, which haspassedno fewer than five laws since 2020 devoted to building a more sophisticated arsenal of economic security tools. In fact, China’s most recent update to its Export Control Lawreplicatedseveral key U.S. export control authorities. The following sections compare U.S., allied, and Chinese export control authorities across list-based, end-user, end-use, and services controls.

List-Based Controls

All U.S. allies implement the list-based controls found in the traditional four multilateral export control regimes. However, as shown in Table 1, they generally do have the ability to implement list-based controls outside of those regimes as well. For example, while the European Union does not have the power to require the imposition of export controls on semiconductor technologies, underArticle 9 of 2021/821, EU member states are empowered to implement unilateral controls on otherwise uncontrolled items for “reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism,” or for “human rights considerations.” The Netherlands specifically referenced Article 9 authorities when it issued itsRegulation on Advanced Production Equipment for Semiconductorsin June 2023, which introduced a license requirement on the export of previously uncontrolled SME from the country. Similarly, when the Japanese government revealed its plans to place license requirements on 23 types of SME in 2023, it did so with authorities granted under itsForeign Exchange and Foreign Trade Actthat was originally passed in 1949.

Although allied countries do have the demonstrated ability to implement list-based controls unilaterally, it is misleading to think of their controls as equivalent to those issued by the United States. For example, no allied country has a meaningful equivalent to the FDPR, nor do they have controls on advanced node semiconductors that apply on a China-wide basis, with thepartial exception of Taiwan. On the other hand, recentchangesto China’s export control system have given Beijing the authority to implement list-based controls that apply on both a country-specific and extraterritorial basis.

End-User Controls

Multilateral export control regimes do not have an equivalent to the U.S. Entity List. As a result, allies have far less robust end-user restrictions than the United States. For example, the European Union and its member states simply do not haveend-user restrictionsand areforcedto use sanctions authorities to impose controls on specific entities. Table 2 summarizes the end-user control landscape.

While Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all have the authority to impose end-user restrictions, their end-user authorities are more limited than the U.S. Entity List. For example, Japan’send-user listonly contains entities involved in the development, production, manufacturing, or storage of WMDs, or certain military end-uses. No allied country has put end-user controls on Chinese AI and semiconductor firms like the United States has, at least not publicly. As with list-based controls, allied countries lag far behind China when it comes to end-user controls. For example, in October 2024, Chinareleasedits new dual-use export control regulation, whichoutlineda U.S. Entity List equivalent. Other regulations such as theUnreliable Entities Listalso give China options to target specific actors.

End-Use Controls

Multilateral export control regimes contain end-use (often referred to as “catch-all”) controls related to WMDs and certain military applications. For example, the Missile Technology Control Regimerequiresmembers to have end-use restrictions “controlling the export of items not included on a control list when they may be intended for use in connection with delivery systems for WMD[s].” Meanwhile, the Wassenaar Arrangement contains a“catch-all” provisiondesigned to control unlisted dual-use items destined for a country subject to an arms embargo and intended for “military end-use.” As shown in Table 3, allied countries’ end-use controls are thus confined to WMD and military applications, with the potential exception of the European Union.2

In contrast, in October 2022, BISintroducedan end-use restriction related to the production of advanced node semiconductors in China. This move marked a major policy change, as U.S. end-use restrictionshadpreviously been limited to situations involving WMDs. China also has the authority to implement end-use controls for reasons unrelated to WMDs. China’s 2020 Export Control Lawprovidesa catch-all for any end-use that likely would endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.” These terms are left largely undefined, providing Beijing with the ability to require licenses for a very broad set of unlisted items on an end-use basis if it desires.

Services Controls

Allied countries surveyed in this paper onlyapplyservices controls for WMD end-uses. However, there is a key difference in how the United States interprets what is covered under WMDs compared to its allies. In October 2022, BISinformedall U.S. persons that the act of supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors and related equipment in China “could involve ‘support’ for . . . weapons of mass destruction-related end uses,” and thus required a license. On the other hand, allied countries do notconsideractivities supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors to be related to WMDs and, as a result, do not imposes services controls on such activities. Table 4 summarizes the services controls landscape.

Despite holding a more limited view of WMD-based export control restrictions than BIS, certain allies do restrict their citizens’ activities related to semiconductor manufacturing through other economic security tools. For example, according to areportby the Semiconductor Industry Association, South Korea has used itsAct on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology“on numerous occasions to prevent firms transferring to mainland China technology deemed detrimental to the industrial competitive capabilities of Korean companies even in the absence of direct links to national security concerns associated with WMDs or conventional weapons.” Taiwan alsorestrictsits citizens and firms from supporting the Chinese semiconductor industry through a variety of regulations unrelated to its export control regime.

Key Gaps Between U.S. and Allied Export Control Regimes

As demonstrated in the previous sections, allied countries possess far less expansive export control authorities than the United States. Although they are all capable of implementing list-based controls on advanced AI chips and SME, their export control tool kit is far narrower than what is available to BIS. For example, while the list-based controls announced by the Netherlands and Japan as part of areported trilateral dealwith the United States were a legitimate breakthrough in allied export control coordination, their controls were weaker than the U.S. regime in at least three important ways. Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Kevin Wolfsummed upthese defects in his February 2023 testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which is quoted below.

[The trilateral deal does not impose] controls on activities of Dutch or Japanese citizens in support of advanced node manufacturing in China. (The new BIS rules prohibit U.S. persons from providing support, even involving uncontrolled foreign-made items, to the development or production of advanced node semiconductors in China.) It will not involve any ally imposing end-user controls such as those related to the EAR’s Entity List. It will also not have controls specific to the . . . production of semiconductor production equipment in China. Thus, Japanese and Dutch companies will still be able to export to China items and services that U.S. competitor companies cannot.

It is worth adding to Wolf’s point that license applications for sales of U.S.-controlled chips to Chinagenerally face“a presumption of denial.” Thus, the U.S. policy imposes what is de jure a license requirement but de facto a ban. This is not always the case for U.S. allies. For example, in July 2023 Reuters reported that Japan’s controlswould not be implementedon a presumption of denial basis.

Only imposing simple list-based restrictions leaves allied countries vulnerable to the same failure modes that plagued earlier versions of the U.S. controls. For example, in July 2019, Japan issued anupdateto its export licensing policies, which removed South Korea from its “white countries” list of trusted trade partners and required individual export licenses for fluorinated polyimide, hydrogen fluoride, and related chemicals. A February 2023 World Bank analysis showed that in the absence of an FDPR equivalent,Japanese firms simply relocated productionof the controlled chemicals from Japan to subsidiaries located in South Korea. While technically legal, these activities were in stark opposition to the intent of Japan’s controls and greatly limited their strategic impact. Similarly, for years the United States blocked direct sales of cutting-edge chips to customersexplicitly affiliatedwith the Chinese military, while allowing those same chips to flow freely to commercial entities in China. While this policy ended direct sales from U.S. companies to the Chinese military, it was mostly ineffective at stopping indirect sales to the shell companies that helped theChinese militaryevade export controls. The October 2022 controls addressed this by implementing restrictions that applied on a China-wide basis. Without equivalent measures, there are good reasons to think that allied countries’ controls will be susceptible to the same diversion risk.

The fact that the Netherlands and Japan used existing authorities to implement unilateral controls on advanced semiconductor technologies also illustrates that analysis of authorities alone yields an incomplete understanding of international semiconductor export control dynamics. Whether Japan and the Netherlands’s reticence can be attributed topoor diplomatic coordinationon behalf of the United States or alack of political willon behalf of its allies is up for debate, but it cannot be entirely attributed to insufficient legal authorities. What is clear is that this delay harmed the U.S. strategic goals vis-à-vis China and its AI and semiconductor ecosystem.

The Dutch and Japanese governments announced their plans to impose controls in line with the October 2022 update in March 2023, but enforcement did not take place until July 2023 in the case of Japan and September 2023 in the case of the Netherlands. This delay allowed Chinese firms to engage in a massive stockpiling effort. According to a Financial Times analysis of Chinese customs data, the total value of Chinese imports of SMEincreased from $2.9 billionin June and July 2022 to $5 billion over the same two months in 2023. The analysis further found that “most of the imports came from the Netherlands and Japan.”

The December 2024 export control updateshowedthat while U.S. policymakers are providing incentives to allies to align themselves with the U.S. export control regime, they are willing to unilaterally restrict the activity of firms headquartered in unaligned countries. For example, South Korean SME and high-bandwidth memory will be restricted by the expanded FDPR even for sales from South Korea, with a possible future exemption if the country implements controls equivalent to those in the United States.

The following sections survey export control policies for the European Union, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China.

CSIS,The AI Diffusion Framework: Securing U.S. AI Leadership While Preempting Strategic Drift,"Published February 18, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/ai-diffusion-framework-securing-us-ai-leadership-while-preempting-strategic-drift,"In one of its final acts, the Biden administration introduced what may be the most ambitious exercise of technological statecraft in modern history—theFramework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion(AI Diffusion Rule). What was once a simple line drawn around China and a small handful of countries has turned into a sweeping, interventionist framework that dictates not just who can import advanced semiconductors and how many, but where they can be deployed, under what conditions they must be secured, and even how AI capabilities can be shared.

In some ways, the framework is a carefully modulated equation, attempting to balance multiple, often competing variables in a single formula. On the one hand, the United States needs to prevent the diversion of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to China, increasingly throughthird countries, to ensure that China never reaches escape velocity in the AI race.DeepSeekmay have tilted the board, but the equation holds—China still faces stubborn compute bottlenecks ininference scalingand deployment.

On the other hand, theexponential growthin compute demand makes it neither practical nor expedient to limit AI infrastructure to U.S. soil. American and allied firms must expand overseas, but every new deployment introduces an additional vector for diversion. This tension is further complicated by market dynamics. U.S. and allied hyperscalers and neocloud providers operate on economic logic, not national security priorities. They will naturally gravitate toward locations where power is cheap, infrastructure hurdles are minimal, and financial incentives sweeten the deal. But for the United States, these same AI-friendly jurisdictions may not always be reliably aligned with its priorities, nor can they be easily insulated from Beijing’s reach.

The AI Diffusion Rule introduces a three-tiered framework for AI access. Tier 1 (T1) countries ride first-class, with near-frictionless access to advanced GPUs. Tier 2 (T2) nations, by contrast, are stuck in coach—allowed on the train but kept at a distance from the front cabin—facing strict caps on GPU access. This is an admission of thepractical limitsof enforcement. Rather than trying to police every node, the rule seeks instead to depressurize the flow of compute globally so there is less surplus floating around that could eventually find its way to China. T2 companies that sever supply chain ties with China and meet stringent compliance standards, however, can import and deploy more GPUs. Together, these controls aim to funnel advanced GPUs into narrow, auditable corridors. The stated objective, however, is clear: to keep T2 countries at least ageneration behind the frontier, which the rule defines as 10²⁶ FLOP—anorder of magnitudebeyond the current capability threshold of 10²⁵ FLOP, where models like GPT-4, Gemini 1 Ultra, and Claude 3 Opus operate. In other words, an upgrade to business class is possible, but first-class is off-limits. Meanwhile, Tier 3 (T3) countries like China are left on the platform, locked out entirely, forced to find their own slower track.

The United States is also taking a full-stack approach to preventing diversion. The framework goes beyond physical hardware controls to close gaps incloud computingaccess andcyber theft of model weights, which are the final mathematical parameters that encode an AI system’s learned capabilities. It is not just about controlling where compute flows, but ensuring that wherever it is deployed, it remains securely barricaded and tethered to U.S. regulatory oversight.

The AI Diffusion Rule is a technocratic tour de force, but at what cost? Observers tend to stall on the obvious, first-order questions. Can Huawei and domestic firms backfill for NVIDIA? Not in the short term. Huawei remains at least one to two generations behind both inGPU performanceandfabrication capacity. Will frontline NATO allies likePoland and the Baltic statesfeel slighted? Yes, and bitterly so.

But while the first cracks are easy to spot, the real risk is what follows. How will T2 countries metabolize the rule, adapt to its constraints, and respond in the long run? Countries have now seen the U.S. export control regime grow by the better part of a thousand pages over 30 months and witnessed the once modest and polite fiction of “small yard, high fence” turn into a global regulatory ordinance.

Moreover, where countries once abided the mailed fist when it was directed against China, they may now recalculate, recognizing that the same grip, once reassuringly distant, can just as easily tighten around their own throats. Well-capitalized AI aspirants in T2 will bristle at the fact that their AI ambitions depend on Washington’s goodwill and that they are being deliberately kept a generation behind the frontier. The presumption that they will meekly accept dependency or permanent subordination is naive.

The default assumption is that T2 countries will either seek to climb into T1 or drift into China’s orbit. They will of course attempt the former. Political opportunism demands nothing less. But this binary framing overlooks a third, and perhaps more disruptive, possibility: A bloc of T2 nations may collectively chart a “Third Way,” not to rival U.S. technological primacy, but to carve out a functional, mid-tier AI stack that provides sufficient strategic autonomy. “De-risking” is often framed as a Western response to China, but T2 nations may now apply the same logic to Washington. The risk for the United States is not open rebellion. It is the slow, deliberate, and accumulative drift away from U.S. control.

Another overlooked fracture in the AI Diffusion Rule is how it may incentivize open-source migration as an escape hatch. If an advanced model is trained on U.S.-controlled hardware, its weights are also now subject to U.S. export controls, unless they are open-sourced and made publicly available. This creates an incentive for T2 nations to lean into open-source AI development. Optically, while the United States builds a walled garden, China, through DeepSeek and other initiatives, positions itself as the patron of open-source development. Ironically, the AI Diffusion Framework, meant to lock in American advantage, may instead midwife the very outcome it sought to prevent—an alternate AI stack and increased open-source development where China, as its most prolific contributor, emerges as the de facto leader.

A common rejoinder is that the AI Diffusion Rule only affects a handful of countries, since most global AI data center capacity isalready concentratedin the United States and T1 nations. But this grossly understates the fallout for economies like Malaysia, which was on track to become the world’sthird-largest data center country by 2026, as well as India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)—nations that had staked their AI ambitions on expanded compute access.

This reasoning also rests on an implicit assumption that T2 countries do not need as much compute, because few were ever serious AI contenders. Leading AI research only takes place in anarrow corridor of countries(e.g., China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States). But saying “you were never going to win anyway” is a significantly different proposition from saying “you are not allowed to try.” No one tells a kid in the United States that they cannot be president. Empire operates on the same principle. Its benefits must always seem within reach, even to those who will never grasp them. Otherwise, it will breed resentment, not cooperation.

Of course, the United States may believe that the risk of AI proliferation is so severe, and the timeline to artificial general intelligenceso short(2–3 years), that the cost of alienating T2 nations is an acceptable trade-off. But if the United States is trying to consolidate long-term control over the global AI stack, this approach may be too heavy-handed and self-defeating.

T1: The Inner Circle

T1 comprises 18 countries and reads like a roll call of long-standing allies:

But like all alliances, the omissions are as telling as the inclusions. Not all of “Old Europe” or NATO made the cut—Greece and Portugal are missing. More strikingly,Poland,Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuaniaare conspicuously absent, despite their vigorous support for U.S. security initiatives, especially in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This partial listing underscores that unofficially, there is a secondary filter. It is not enough to be a stalwart ally on paper; to guarantee lockstep compliance, the United States wants partners whose re-export controls and enforcement frameworks mirror its own. For Washington, even otherwise-dependable allies may fall short if they lack the institutional capacity, enforcement rigor, and willingness to guarantee strict adherence, or if they are viewed as potential diversion risks.

T2: Eclectic Middle Ground

The lion’s share of nations fall into T2, a catch-all group that lumps together an eclectic mix of countries with vastly different levels of trust, capacity, and AI ambitions. India, Israel, Singapore, and Switzerland are placed alongside Yemen. There are several reasons why countries may have ended up in T2. Some, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have emerged askey investors in AIbut remain outside the Western intelligence-sharing orbit. Others, such as India, are forging close strategic and trade ties with the United States but have a legacy of nonalignment. Switzerland, with its long-standing tradition offierce neutrality, fits a similar mold. Meanwhile, countries in Southeast Asia and those in Eastern Europe that are officially close U.S. partners have been flagged asdiversion risks.

T3: The Usual Suspects

T3 is a familiar roster of U.S.arms-embargoed countries—China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, joined by the likes of Burma (Myanmar), Syria, and Venezuela.

T1 countries will have unrestricted access to advanced GPUs. Companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent in a T1 country can deploy as much computing power as they want within T1 nations. Through a one-time Universal Validated End User (UVEU) authorization, they can also deploy GPUs in T2 countries, albeit within certain limits. Beyond access to hardware, the rule also ring-fences the training of frontier models in T1 countries.

However, even T1 status comes with conditions. U.S.-headquartered companies must keep at least 50 percent of total AI compute in the United States, 75 percent in T1 countries overall, and no more than 7 percent in any single T2 country.

The numbers are striking. But based on data from the AI and semiconductor research firmSemiAnalysis, the bulk of AI data center capacity is already concentrated in the United States and T1 countries—over 50 percent in the United States alone and more than 75 percent across T1 nations. SemiAnalysisfurther projects10+ gigawatt (GW)-scale campuses coming online in the United States over the next two years, reinforcing its lead. Figure 2 shows the stark regional disparities in planned data center capacity through 2027, with North America dominating global capacity—roughly four times larger than either Europe and the Middle East or Asia Pacific, while Latin America trails behind for now.

To qualify, however, companies must meet19 separate certification and policy requirements, covering everything from GPU installation reporting and transit security to personnel vetting, monitoring, recordkeeping, and even sanitization and disposal procedures. The strictest requirements revolve around cybersecurity controls for model weights, mandating rate-limiting on data access and restricting interactions to narrowly defined application programming interfaces (APIs) to prevent rapid exfiltration and unauthorized probing of models through interfaces.

In addition, UVEUs must follow “know your customer” (KYC) and red flag guidance, including notifying authorities when training an advanced model. The primary concern is subsidiaries conducting large-scale training runs above the prescribed threshold (i.e., 10²⁶ FLOP) and then transferring model weights to China. Collectively, these safeguards are designed to prevent GPU diversion, unauthorized access, and the theft of model weights.

For companies that clear these hurdles, the payoff is substantial: a near-universal hall pass, granting broad authorization to scale AI infrastructure worldwide. UVEUs will also be exempt from the restrictions on model weights—which, under the rules of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), otherwise require a license to export, re-export, or even transfer within a country—provided the destination is a T1 country.

BIS has imposed country-level caps on advanced GPUs for T2 nations, measured bytotal processing performance(TPP), a metric quantifying aggregate compute capacity.

However, TPP is abstract and lacks immediate real-world clarity. As such, a conversion method is often employed to translate TPP into a more tangible benchmark—NVIDIA’s H100equivalents, the current industry standard for AI workloads.

Each T2 country receives a fixed allocation of 49,901 H100-equivalent GPUs through 2027. This is not an annual quota—once exhausted, whether in 2025 or 2026, no additional GPUs can be imported until after 2027. To accommodate smaller-scale needs, BIS allows T2 entities to acquire up to 1,699 H100-equivalents without a license, though they must notify BIS. These purchases do not count toward the 49,901 H100-equivalent installed base cap, offering flexibility for low-volume imports.

The Shrinking Reality of 50,000 and 1,700 GPU Caps

At first glance, an allocation of ~50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs, which would cost roughly $1.25 billion, appears substantial—roughly more than double the computeused to trainGPT-4, which was trained on roughly 25,000 less-performant A100 chips. However, the H100 will soon become a previous-generation chip, set to be replaced in 2025 by NVIDIA’s newerB200andGB300GPUs. When the permitted TPP is converted into these next-generation units usingnumbers from SemiAnalysis, the effective number of GPUs shrinks—from 50,000 H100s to 21,987 B200s, and then 13,192 GB300s.

This downward trend accelerates when accounting for hardware improvement rates. According toEpoch AI, ML hardware performance has doubled every 1.9 years, meaning that by 2027, a 13,192 GB300 allocation will be effectively reduced by half. Similarly, the seemingly permissive ~1,700 H100 threshold for small purchases translates tofewer than 500 GB300 GPUsand an even smaller number of 2027-equivalents. These calculations reveal how quickly nominally generous caps become more restrictive, limiting the compute available to T2 nations in practice. It is worth noting that future hardware performance is uncertain. NVIDIA's generational leaps might yield larger or smaller performance gains than projected and come sooner or later than expected.

Companies from T2 countries looking to deploy a significant number of GPUs can apply for a National Validated End User (NVEU) authorization, provided they meet stringent security requirements.

By so doing, they receive an export license allowing a phased-in installed base of up to approximately 100,000 H100 equivalents by the end of 2025, 270,000 by the end of 2026, and 320,000 by the end of 2027. Again, these are not trivial numbers. 100,000 H100s is three times larger than the compute capacity ofxAI’s Colossus supercomputer facilityin Memphis, Tennessee, the largest U.S. GPU cluster in 2024.

However, as discussed earlier, these caps shrink dramatically when accounting for hardware improvements. When the allocation is converted, the 320,000 H100 equivalents allowed drops to 140,666 B200 equivalents and 84,400 GB300 equivalents. Factoring in hardware improvements—i.e., doubling every 1.9 years—this number shrinks even further.

In order to obtain NVEU status, T2 applicants are “strongly encouraged” to first secure a government-to-government assurance before seeking approval from four federal agencies—the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and Energy. While UVEU applicants must also clear this multi-agency review, T2 firms facestructural disadvantagescompared to T1 hyperscalers and neoclouds, which already operate within established compliance frameworks, observability systems, and security protocols, making many of the requirements routine. In addition, T2 NVEU applicants will also face heightened scrutiny in demonstrating efforts to sever supply chain dependencies with China. While not all countries are equally exposed, many haveintegratedChinese networking equipment and hardware into their infrastructure due to cost advantages, making compliance both technically complex and costly.

There will be a presumption of denial for all T3 countries—in regulatory parlance, that means an automatic “no” for any export license applications involving T3 entities. None of the streamlined “VEU” routes (universal or national) apply. In principle, a T3 company cannot just waltz through licensing hoops—it is effectively shut out.

The impact of the rule will, unsurprisingly, be uneven. While it is tempting to cast T1 as the “winners” and T2 as the “losers,” this would be an oversimplification. Even within each tier, the outcomes will be far from uniform—some T1 countries will gain disproportionately, while others in T2 will feel the brunt of the restrictions more acutely.

Surprisingly, some T2 countries may benefit under the new rules. For instance, entities in parts of theMiddle East and Central Asia—where any chip purchase previously required an export license—now have pathways to access controlled chips without a license, provided they stay within the bounds of low-volume purchase pathways (LPPs) or individual country allocations. Countries like the UAE, which spent months negotiating deals such as the Microsoft-G42 partnership and has already secured amemorandum of understandingwith the United States, will welcome the added clarity and are well-positioned to obtain an NVEU status. Conversely, other T2 nations that previously faced no restrictions will now find their access significantly tightened.

Broadly speaking, the new rule is likely to be anet negative for T2 nationswith significant AI data center capacity pipelines, particularly if that capacity is not slated for use by U.S. hyperscalers.

Based onSemiAnalysis data,Malaysiawill be the hardest-hit country. Its data center capacity has been surging, rising from just 100 megawatts (MW) in 2023 to a projected ~3.5 GW by 2027, and positioning it to become the world’s third-largest data center country, behind the United States and China, by 2026.

Nearly half of Malaysia’s projected 2027 capacity is optimized for cutting-edge NVIDIA AI accelerators, with facilities capable of supporting power densities of up to130 kilowatts (kW) per rack. This has drawn major investments, including NVIDIA’s$4.3 billion partnershipwith Malaysian conglomerate YTL to build supercomputing facilities and cloud AI services.

Malaysia is likely to get caught in the crosshairs of the rule as it become a key destination for Chinese colocation and leasing activities. By 2027, ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is expected to lease628 MWof its total data center capacity. Similarly, DayOne (formerly GDS) is adding415 MWby 2026, much of which is leased to ByteDance.

Oracle finds itself in a bind—hence the escalating blog posts from Executive Vice President Ken Glueck onDecember 19,January 5, andFebruary 4. Oracle’s strategy relied heavily on Malaysia, with$6.5 billion in planned investmentsthat will likely exceed the new7 percent country capfor T2 nations. While it could theoretically rebalance through aggressive expansion in T1 countries, this would require significant new investment and strategic repositioning.

After Malaysia,Indiawill be the hardest-hit county. However, unlike Malaysia, India’s AI infrastructure is more closely tied to U.S. hyperscalers, offering some insulation from the restrictions. Still, with ~3 GW of planned data center capacity, India closely rivals Malaysia in scale, but has even larger ambitions.Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person and chairman of Reliance Industries, recently announced plans to build a3 GW mega data centercampus in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which would be the world’s largest, with a projected investment of $20–30 billion. The facility is intended for AI workloads and isexpected to rely onNVIDIA’s leading-edge Blackwell AI processors. The new restrictions threaten to derail these initiatives, potentially thwarting India’s aspirations.

Beyond Malaysia,Southeast Asia overallis likely to suffer.

Singaporewas anearly moverin the data center boom of the 2000s, leveraging its connectivity infrastructure. But its energy constraints quickly caught up. In 2019, Singapore imposed amoratoriumon new data centers after projections showed theycould consume12 percent of the nation’s electricity by 2030. Since then, Singapore has allocated modest expansions—80 MW for four new data centersby 2023 and a2024 pledge to add 300 MW, prioritizing green energy options. Given its fundamental constraints, however, Singapore’s growth will remain capped, relying on reshuffling its deck to retire legacy facilities and optimize existing capacity.

Indonesia, meanwhile, is less handicapped by similar limitations and has been muscling in on the AI data center space. It recently completedPhase 1 of the BDx CGK4 campusin Jatiluhur—a renewable-powered AI data center park,scalable up to 500 MW, offering high power density of up to120 kW per rack, liquid cooling technologies, and high-speed connectivity to meet the demands of AI workloads.

Indonesia’s ample land, energy, and ability to leverage renewable power have also made it a natural magnet for Chinese investment, with Tencent Holdings pledging$500 millionto develop its third data center in the country by 2030.

Brazilwill be the most affected country in Latin America and has positioned itself as a regional AI data center powerhouse. Leading the charge is Scala Data Centers, whose São Paulo campus is set to expand beyond 350 MW, but its real centerpiece is the so-calledAI City—a proposed 4.75 GW campus that will cost upward of $90 billion. Ordinarily, such a proposal would be laughed out of the room, but the proposed site islocatednext to an idle 3 GW substation and surrounded by untapped wind and hydro power, resources that few other nations can match. With the right financial backing, it could be the largest AI data center in the world. The new U.S. restrictions would, however, significantly undercut these plans.

While theUAEandSaudi Arabiashow relatively small confirmed capacities through 2027, this understates their long-term aspirations, with several gigawatt-scale projects that extend well beyond 2027. Most, however, have not yet started earthworks. The Gulf states possess two distinct advantages: huge energy reserves and the ability to deploy state-backed capital with near-limitless patience to build the next generation of AI data centers.

Near-term development is led by G42/Khazna, with406 MW of planned capacityacross 13 campuses, including a flagship 100 MW Dubai Ajman campus. However, its true ambitions are reflected in its longer-term plans. According toSemiAnalysis, G42/Khazna is planning a staggering 5 GW aggregate pipeline across the Middle East, while Google is eyeing a 3 GW pipeline near Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Energy Park.

While the AI Diffusion Rule does not create outright “winners,” apart from the United States, which by design will be the primary beneficiary, T1 countries’ AI infrastructure plans will not be at risk and can proceed without regulatory headwinds. In addition, they are likely to siphon off deployments originally earmarked for T2 nations now caught in the rule’s constraints. Based onSemiAnalysis data, Australia emerges as a standout case among T1 nations, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan, Ireland, Germany, Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, and Spain. In fact, nine out of eighteen T1 countries have more than 1 GW of planned AI data center capacity, compared to just four countries across all T2 countries, with five T1 countries exceeding 2 GW of planned capacity.

Australiawill likely be the largest beneficiary of the rule, particularly in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, with its ~3 GW of planned capacity. Australia’s energy landscape provides a crucial competitive advantage. Unlike Japan and South Korea, which rely heavily on imported energy, Australia isone of the world’s largest energy exporters. Australia’s consistentyear-round solar irradiationalso translates directly to data center economics, enabling cost-effective power purchase agreements (PPAs) for data center operators.

Moreover, colocation accounts for approximately75 percentof Australia’s market. While hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and AWS can self-build and operate their own facilities, colocation providers offer a compelling alternative: ready-to-use data center facilities that cloud providers can quickly lease, which means lower capital requirements and faster time to market.

The Australian market is anchored bythree mature colocation providersthat rank among the world’s best—the “three Goliaths”: AirTrunk, NextDC, and Canberra Data Centers (CDC).NextDC’s 550 MW mega campusdemonstrates its capacity for large-scale development, while the ability of AirTrunk, a homegrown success story, todeploydirect-to-chip liquid cooling is particularly significant as the industry faces a big transition: NVIDIA’s upcoming Blackwell AI chips (GB200)requirethis advanced cooling technology to handle power densities up to 130 kW per rack. Many data center operators globally, including tech giant Meta, have had to completelyredesign facilitiesto accommodate these new requirements.

What truly distinguishes the “three Goliaths” is their focus—instead of serving a broad mix of enterprise clients, they primarily build for hyperscale cloud providers—and already well understand their exacting technical requirements and scaling needs. Combined with its privileged T1 status under the new rules, Australia is ideally positioned to capture displaced AI computing demand from restricted Southeast Asian markets like Malaysia.

The AI Diffusion Rule will funnel T2 countries toward U.S. hyperscalers and allied T1 neoclouds as the default gateway to advanced compute, which the U.S. largely controls, creating a de facto lock-in of AI infrastructure worldwide.

The rule is not just about controlling who gets access to U.S. compute; it is also about forcing countries to choose sides. In order to secure U.S. compute, T2 NVEU applicants will also have to sever supply chain dependencies with China—i.e., they need to declare for Washington and eject Beijing, or risk falling behind. But company-level decoupling will not suffice; securing U.S. approval will require formal government assurances at the national level to get into Washington’s good graces.

Creating Economic Pressure: The Approval Gap Between UVEU and NVEU

While the path to securing NVEU status appears straightforward, as highlighted previously, the process presents significant practical hurdles that could create dangerous delays for countries with ambitious AI data center plans.

Many projects, like those in Malaysia, are purpose-built for top-end AI training, with ultra-dense power racks, advanced liquid cooling, and infrastructure optimized for next-generation chips like NVIDIA’s Blackwell line. Yet, even with an NVEU license, TPP limitations and supply constraints may prevent operators from acquiring enough state-of-the-art GPUs to fill those racks. Meanwhile, Tier 1 license holders face a 7 percent limit on how much of their total compute can be deployed in any single country, creating further uncertainty for T2 data centers looking to secure large clients.

Operators could repurpose racks for older GPUs, but these do not require the high-density cooling and power infrastructure already in place, turning specialized, high-capex facilities into underutilized white elephants. A retrofit for lower-performance workloads also undermines the original investment altogether.

Moreover, the economics are unforgiving. Modern data center projects require billions in upfront capital expenditure—from land acquisition and power infrastructure to advanced cooling systems. These investments are typicallyhighly leveraged, with financing structures that assume rapid customer deployment to generate cash flow for debt service.

Even short delays awaiting NVEU approval leave these specialized facilities vulnerable. Loan payments may come due without corresponding revenue from AI workloads, but incurring the same fixed costs for maintenance, security, and staff. For operators and investors, the choice will be clear. Unfilled racks mean certain losses. They will likely lease to T1 hyperscalers who can deploy immediately under UVEU status, or risk their facilities becoming stranded assets.

Lock-In Effects

The framework effectively drives T2 compute capacity toward U.S. hyperscalers and T1 neoclouds, which gain preferential access to T2 markets. But the implications go beyond just access to compute. Hyperscalers and neoclouds also offer stable service-level agreements and robust developer ecosystems (e.g., CUDA libraries), with better track records for uptime, enterprise-grade support, and compliance. Over time, the cost and friction of switching to alternative providers like Huawei would become prohibitively high. Migrating datasets, restructuring technical operations, retraining staff, and rebuilding applications would impose significant costs and operational challenges, reinforcing lock-in effects.

The Hardware Gap: China’s Compute Gap

The assumption that China can immediately compensate for U.S. controls with domestic alternatives is not supportable with current evidence. In the near term, China faces significant constraints in both the quality and quantity of chips it can produce.

Quality Gap:Huawei’s Ascend series and other Chinese GPU alternatives lag behind NVIDIA by one to two generations. According toChris Miller, Huawei’s most advanced AI chip, the Ascend 910B, achieves only 280–400 TeraFLOPS compared to 2,250 TeraFLOPS for NVIDIA’s most advanced Blackwell chips. This performance differential of 5.6–8x is reflected in real-world adoption. According toEpoch AI, of263 documented AI modelswhere hardware was known, only two used Huawei Ascend chips, while 31 Chinese organizations relied on NVIDIA hardware. EvenDeepSeektrained its models on NVIDIA H800s.

Quantity Gap:SemiAnalysis projectsthat China will produce just 1.8 million Huawei Ascend 910B/910C GPUs by the end of 2025, while U.S. AI labs and hyperscalers are projected to deploy14.3 million AI acceleratorsin the United States, which are significantly more performant, suggesting an even larger compute gap at the aggregate national level. This limited fabrication capacity means that China will likely prioritize domestic needs, limiting their ability to offer a credible alternative to U.S. technology in global markets.

It is worth cautioning that this technology gapmay not be permanent. In the medium to long term, forced localization and state-backed capital might narrow China’s performance gap from one generation behind to on par or slightly behind.

Second-Tier Status, First-Tier Ambitions

T2 countries will, of course, publicly acquiesce to U.S. restrictions. But diplomatic accommodation should not be mistaken for genuine alignment. India, the Gulf states, and other well-capitalized AI aspirants will bristle in private that their AI ambitions depend on Washington’s goodwill. The fact that T2 nations are being deliberately kept a generation behind the frontier will also rankle. It is a public, institutionalized reminder that no matter how much they invest, they are not allowed to be first-tier players.

The False Binary: The United States vs. China vs. a Third Way

There is a tendency to view AI geopolitics through a Cold War–style binary—that nations must either align with the United States or drift into China’s orbit. But this overlooks a third possibility that T2 nations, far from being passive satellites, may seek their own path. T2 nations have no desire to be entirely captive to either the United States or China.

2019 is often cited as China’s “9/11 moment,” when theHuawei and ZTE sanctionsforced Beijing to embark on a massive technological self-sufficiency push. The AI Diffusion Rule may trigger a similar reckoning for T2 countries. One may argue that the two are not analogous. After all, Beijing was explicitly cut off, while T2 countries still receive a permissive allocation under the new framework.

But that misses the underlying dynamic. No country makes economic security decisions on the basis of GPUs alone. Increasingly muscular U.S. economic security measures, especially against close allies likeCanada, will force capitals to rethink long-term dependencies on U.S. technology.

Short-Term Adjustments, Long-Term Realignment

Of course, this will not happen overnight. In the near term, T2 nations will maximize their initial allocation of 50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs. Given that access is first come, first served, sovereign AI initiatives will ramp up—governments will ensure national priorities dictate GPU access, rather than individual firms. We may also see the rise of regional compute corridors, with nations pooling resources to overcome individual capacity limits.

In the immediate time frame, these countries will likely procure whatever GPUs they can—via U.S.-validated entities (UVEUs) or the narrower NVEU status. As access to U.S. compute becomes increasingly conditional, however, or simply in anticipation of future friction, well-resourced nations will start to invest in their own high-performance computing infrastructure, aiming not to match the raw performance of top-end GPUs—a feat even China struggles with—but to build a functional, mid-tier alternative capable of supporting AI applications. Rather than attempting to replicate leading-edge GPUs, these collaborations could focus on specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for narrow but critical industrial and commercial AI workloads.

RISC-V-based AI accelerators, designed collaboratively and manufactured in existing T2 facilities, present another pathway. Unlike proprietary architectures likex86 or Arm—both of which are subject to U.S. restrictions—RISC-V’s open-source nature allows nations to design their own AI accelerators. That said, RISC-V is not an immediate off-ramp. WhileAlibabahas developed XuanTie RISC-V cores, most RISC-V AI efforts remain in their early stages, requiring significant investment and development. Claiming it as a ready solution for compute sovereignty overstates its current capabilities. But dismissing it entirely would ignore incentives to fast-track progress.

If Washington was already concerned about China’s push fordesign-out, the risk now multiplies exponentially. By overplaying its hand, the United States creates a potential alternate compute stack, operating beyond American control.

The Open-Source Escape Valve

As highlighted earlier, the weights of any model trained using U.S.-controlled compute are subject to U.S. export restrictions if they exceed 10²⁶ FLOP—unless they are open-sourced. At first glance, this creates an incentive for T2 nations to lean into open-source frontier AI development to sidestep U.S. regulatory controls.

However, in practice, this escape valve may not be as open as it seems. T2 countries will likely lack the domestic compute capacity to train models beyond 10²⁶ FLOP, meaning they would need to rent compute. But this raises a liability risk—how can a T2 entity credibly prove, before training begins, that it will follow through on open-sourcing the model weights? Without a mechanism to verify intent pre-training, compute providers may simply deny access upfront rather than gamble on post-training compliance. As such, T2 players may find themselves effectively boxed out of both closed- and open-source frontier AI development.

But even if U.S. restrictions block T2 nations from training frontier open-source models, they may trigger a different kind of shift—an acceleration toward compute-efficient, open-source AI development. DeepSeek has already demonstrated that scarcity breeds optimization. What happens when the broader open-source world, united by shared limitations, begins running in the same direction? There is also a curious inversion at play. While the United States moves to lock down and consolidate global compute, China is positioning itself as the provider of last resort, offering high-quality, cost-effective open-source models that others can build on. Instead of needing access to U.S. AI infrastructure, developers could simply build atop China’s open-source stack.

T2 states do not need a formal conspiracy with Beijing. But their independent hedging efforts, driven by frustration with U.S. licensing constraints, may naturally dovetail with China’s open-source push. Instead of reinforcing a U.S.-led order, Washington’s grip could weaken and lead to a world where open-source autonomy, championed by China, becomes the default escape hatch.

The Fragile Equilibrium and Conditions for Unraveling

By tying advanced compute access to strict controls, Washington risks turning T2 countries into reluctant vassals who start looking for side doors at the earliest opportunity.

Regulatory partitions have a half-life. The policy will only hold as long as:

The AI Diffusion Rule assumes that lock-in will hold because switching costs are high. But if history tells us anything, it is that whenever an access-restricted market grows large enough, the incentive to develop alternatives eventually outweighs the costs of remaining dependent.

It is more likely than not that the AI Diffusion Rule will be embraced and further expanded by the Trump administration. It aligns with a broader escalation of the China containment playbook, fits neatly into an “America First” approach, and serves as a powerful negotiating cudgel to compel T2 nations to align more closely with Washington’s AI agenda.

But splintering is not inevitable. There are viable policy pathways to preempt T2 strategic drift and allow the United States to maintain control over the global AI stack.

In some ways, the United States has crossed the Rubicon, and there is no retreat. China will continue its drive for AI self-sufficiency regardless of U.S. actions. But export controls are like self-replicating automata. They tend to expand with each iteration, creating new loopholes, countermeasures, and pressures for escalation. A more adaptive approach, however—one that balances U.S. leadership with credible pathways for allies—could allow Washington to have its cake and eat it too. If there is a better hand to play, now is the time to find it. And if there is anyone that thrives on breaking and remaking the playbook, it is President Trump.

CSIS,AI Security Strategy and South Korea’s Challenges,"Published June 20, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/ai-security-strategy-and-south-koreas-challenges,"AI has emerged as a foundational component in the twenty-first-century digital power competition. Its influence extends far beyond technological innovation, encompassing military, cybersecurity, and sociocultural dimensions. Early leadership in core AI technologies—including AI algorithms, chipsets, and large language models—offers not only economic advantages but also strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty. However, due to its inherently dual-use nature, AI presents complex security challenges; it can be leveraged to enhance weapons automation, amplify the scale and precision of cyberattacks, and facilitate the rapid dissemination of disinformation.

There are already real-world examples of AI being used as a national security threat. In theRussia-Ukraine war, AI-powered drones were used for target recognition and automated strikes. During theIsrael-Hamas conflict, AI technologies were used to identify attack targets. In addition,Googlehas reported that over 57 state-backed hacking groups—including those from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia—are using AI to advance cyberattacks and information operations. These developments underscore the urgency of integrating AI security into national defense planning and international security frameworks.

In March 2024, South Korea adopted theUN resolutionon safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. In May 2024, the South Korean government announced the “Seoul Declaration for Safe, Innovative, and Inclusive AI” during the AI Seoul Summit. Domestically, the government has pushed efforts to promote AI use and improve safety, including launching anational AI strategy, establishing the National AI Committee, and creating an AI Safety Research Institute. In January 2025, the “AI Basic Act” was passed and is scheduled to take effect in January 2026.

The AI Basic Act is a comprehensive law aimed at promoting the development of AI technology and building public trust. It covers national-level policies for AI development, support for industry growth, data center initiatives, ethical principles, obligations to ensure transparency and safety, and regulations for high-risk and generative AI systems. It introduces a risk management system to ensure the overall safety of AI systems and adopts a certification-based trust mechanism. It is designed to guarantee private sector autonomy, while the public sector oversees the process to ensure that appropriate levels of safety and accountability are upheld. In particular, AI systems that are likely to have a significant impact on human life, safety, or fundamental rights are designated as “high impact” and subject to strict safety requirements.

In addition to the National AI Committee, a new interagency body—theNational AI Security Consultative Group—was launched in March 2025. To address national security threats arising from the use and spread of AI, the National Security Office was designated as the control tower, with the National Intelligence Service (NIS)—which oversees South Korea’s cybersecurity—serving as the lead coordinating agency.

Despite these broad efforts, South Korea’s AI strategy and legal framework still focus more on industry promotion and safety than national security. Article 4 of the AI Basic Act excludes national defense and security uses of AI from its scope, based on the assumption that other agencies handle those areas separately and are hard to align with civilian regulations. However, even outside the act, there is no clear legal basis for using AI in national defense or security, making it difficult to build solid strategies for such uses.

Also, unlike theEU AI Act—which classifies risk into four levels and applies regulation accordingly—South Korea’s framework minimizes or excludes regulation for most low-risk AI systems. But even low-risk systems can become serious national security threats if misused intentionally or systematically. This means a security-centered update is needed.

The AI Safety Research Institute, defined under the act, currently has only14 staff members. The institute has been assigned a wide range of responsibilities—including safety evaluation, policy research, tech development, standardization, and international cooperation. Given this scope, it may not have the capacity to focus deeply on AI risks in defense and security contexts.

Moreover, while the law includes provisions to ensure the safety and trustworthiness of AI systems, it does not explicitly use the term “cybersecurity,” nor does it address specific measures against hacking or cyberattacks. It also lacks clear connections to existing laws on cybersecurity or data protection. This suggests that cybersecurity—despite being a core component of AI security—is addressed only within the broader concept of general safety.

South Korea’s national AI strategy includes plans to develop AI-related defense policies and infrastructure, but the direction remains vague. The newly elected president emphasized AI innovation incampaign pledges, with no reference to AI security. Moreover, the roles of various ministries and working groups remain ambiguous and operate in parallel, raising concerns about overlap and a lack of coordination.

In 2024, the United States officially designated AI as a national security asset through itsNational Security Memorandum. Under the Biden administration, the government took the lead in strengthening AI-related security by issuing anExecutive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI. This included efforts to set and verify security standards for AI models, including cybersecurity protections.

In 2025, the Trump administration repealed the previous executive order but emphasized economic security by issuing a new order—Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence. This order aimed to lower domestic regulatory barriers while maintaining national security through export controls that limit adversarial countries’ access to advanced AI technologies. Additionally, the2025 National Defense Authorization Actemphasized the use of AI for national defense operations, cybersecurity, and biotechnology. The Department of Defense has also directed the use of AI to detect cyber threats within theDefense Industrial Base. U.S. intelligence and defense agencies, such as theOffice of the Director of National Intelligenceand theDepartment of Defense, are currently operating AI-based systems for threat detection and information analysis.

The United Kingdom also considers AI a national strategic asset. It has expanded AI use not only for economic growth but also for national security purposes, while simultaneously strengthening AI security. These priorities are reflected in theAI Opportunities Action Plan 2025and theStrategic Defence Review. In terms of cybersecurity, the United Kingdom adopts aguidance-based, advisory approachrather than centralized regulation and seeks to enhance cybersecurity across the AI supply chain. In February 2025, the United Kingdom renamed its “AI Safety Institute” to the “AI Security Institute,” shifting the focus from general safety to countering national-level threats such as AI-driven cyberattacks, criminal use, and biological weapons.

These developments in U.S. national and economic security policy have a significant impact not only on South Korea but also on global tech policies, export strategies, and industrial ecosystems. In January 2025, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security announced anew export control policy for AI. Although it has now been repealed and is under review for replacement, the policy would expand the Entity List and apply the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which extends U.S. export restrictions to foreign-made products using U.S. technology. This move is seen as a way to fill gaps in allied export regulations and intensify restrictions on China. The recent U.S. Department of Commerce restrictions onHuawei chipsare part of this trend. As a result, South Korea may face indirect pressure and regulatory risks concerning AI chip manufacturing and semiconductor exports. Such pressure could disrupt the stable supply of high-performance chips and hinder South Korea’s ability to secure computing infrastructure and develop key AI technologies for national security.

Moreover, the United States and the United Kingdom’s efforts to modernize their AI-based defense and cybersecurity systems could set new technical and policy standards for allies like South Korea. These developments highlight the growing need for interoperability and intelligence sharing among allied countries. For South Korea, this means ensuring a certain level of AI capability and cyber defense strength to remain a viable partner in international security cooperation and technological alliances.

Additionally, in contrast to their participation in the 2023–2024 AI Safety Summits, the United States and the United Kingdom did not sign theParis Declarationon the ethical development of AI during the 2025 Paris summit. This came shortly after the release of China’s DeepSeek model and is viewed as part of a broader effort to assert leadership in AI and counter China’s growing influence. This demonstrates that even among allies, countries differ in their approaches to AI safety and security, which underscores the need for more multilayered and adaptive frameworks for international cooperation capable of addressing diverse and emerging issues.

As global competition over AI intensifies, cooperation with trusted international allies has become essential, even for technologically advanced nations. South Korea, as a key U.S. ally and a strategic hub for Indo-Pacific security and advanced technology collaboration, plays a pivotal role. However, the current absence of a robust and comprehensive AI security framework in South Korea poses challenges to allied technological cohesion. Specifically, it may impede effective information sharing, reduce interoperability, and weaken joint deterrence and threat response strategies.

Strengthening South Korea’s AI security capabilities is essential to expand its responsibilities as a strategic partner. Doing so would not only reduce the overall security burden on the United States but also contribute to the strategic stability of their technology alliance. A stronger cooperation framework would also enhance mutual trust between the two countries and improve the effectiveness of joint risk management. This could be achieved through coordinated U.S.–South Korea collaboration that is flexibly adjustable based on shared interests. In particular, AI and semiconductor export control policies would benefit from close dialogue to ensure they are aligned with both countries’ long-term goals of technological cooperation and supply chain resilience. At the operational level, both countries should strengthen policy and technical cooperation to lay the groundwork for shared growth.

South Korea should consolidate its central role in the global semiconductor supply chain while also positioning itself as a strategic leader in AI technologies and security infrastructure. This requires dividing roles with allies based on complementary strengths in key areas—such as AI chips, cloud infrastructure, and data centers—while reinforcing its own core capabilities. Such efforts would contribute to building a more resilient and trust-based global supply chain.

Domestically, South Korea should establish the institutional framework for leveraging AI in defense and national security. This requires clear legal and strategic frameworks for the secure use of AI. It is also necessary to clarify and streamline the roles of various agencies and security councils to reduce overlap and establish coordinated structures. In addition to the existing AI Safety Institute—which primarily focuses on mitigating ethical and safety risks in the private sector—South Korea should consider designating a separate institution dedicated to addressing national security threats. This body should be empowered with clear mandates, sufficient resources, and the authority to develop and implement security-focused AI technologies and policies. Its responsibilities would include identifying emerging threats and ensuring the safe integration of advanced AI tools into military and governmental systems.

In parallel, South Korea must strengthen its technical capabilities in key areas such as AI-based threat detection, automated response systems, and cyberattack prediction. Active participation in U.S.- and UK-led AI safety assessment frameworks, global technical standards, and information-sharing mechanisms will be important. In particular, there must be a system to quickly assess how advanced private-sector technologies can be safely integrated into national security systems.

Ultimately, AI must be viewed not only as a driver of innovation and industrial development but also as a strategic asset essential to national defense. This requires adopting a comprehensive national security perspective on the AI ecosystem—including data, semiconductors, and cloud infrastructure—and promoting greater public and institutional awareness of its long-term strategic implications.

CSIS,Beyond Rare Earths: China’s Growing Threat to Gallium Supply Chains,"Published July 17, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/beyond-rare-earths-chinas-growing-threat-gallium-supply-chains,"China is increasingly weaponizing its chokehold over critical minerals amid intensifying economic and technological competition with the United States. The critical mineral gallium, which is crucial to defense industry supply chains and new energy technologies, has been at the front line of China’s strategy. To date, China’s chokehold on rare earth metals has attracted more attention than its restrictions on gallium, and some have downplayed the potential consequences of disruptions to gallium supply chains. Yet CSIS analysis reveals the extent to which China can wield gallium to impose significant economic harm on the United States and its allies and partners. This CSIS Brief unpacks the scope of the problem and offers policy recommendations on how to bolster U.S. and allied economic security and deny China a key tool of economic warfare.

Amid spiraling trade tensions with the United States, Beijing has brandished anew arsenalof economic weapons, with few proving more potent than its export controls on critical minerals. As of May 2025, China hadrestrictedthe export of at least 16 key minerals and alloys, many of which are essential inputs for products ranging from consumer electronics to F-35 fighter jets. These measures have struck deep into U.S. and allied supply chains, and appear to have given China substantial leverage in its ongoing trade and technology negotiations with the United States.

As the impacts of these controls hit global markets, examining the case of gallium—a little-known but crucial metal—offers a powerful warning signal. China has a near-total monopoly over gallium production, accounting for a startling 98 percent of the world’s primary supply. The mineral was among the first to be caught in the escalating tit-for-tat trade restrictions between the United States and China, making headlines when itlandedon Beijing’s export control list (alongside germanium) in July 2023.

That initial broadside was largely awarning shotdesigned to showcase Beijing’s capacity to impose pain on sensitive U.S. supply chains while limiting broader impacts on the global economy. Now, China is tightening the screws.

New research by CSIS, supported by data provided by minerals supply chain intelligence companyRovjok, reveals that China’s gallium restrictions are having a greater impact than previously anticipated. This is due to both tighter enforcement against transshipment and new controls on specialized gallium extraction technologies that are not available outside China.

This brief presents several key findings:

Responding to this mounting crisis will require the United States to take urgent steps to develop alternative sources of gallium supply and extraction technologies. Fortunately, the financial investments needed are relatively modest and promising solutions are well within reach—but only with a level of sustained policy attention that has only just begun to materialize.

China’s use of critical mineral export controls is not a new phenomenon, but it has evolved in recent years from a policy bludgeon to a precision tool. A defining early example came in 2011, when Beijing temporarilywithheldrare earth exports to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. China backed off from those restrictions within months, but not before sending rare earth prices skyrocketing over 80 percent and leaving Japanese officials scrambling for alternatives.

In 2019, China trained this threat against the United States. As trade frictions flared under the first Trump administration, Chinese leader Xi Jinping publiclyvisiteda rare earth processing facility in a conspicuous warning about the potential costs of further escalation.

Over the ensuing years, China further strengthened its hand by developing a legal and regulatory framework to transform these scattered actions into a comprehensive export control system. In 2020, the Chinese legislaturepassedthe Export Control Law, which gave Beijing streamlined authorities to exercise “control on the export of dual-use items.” Unprecedented in Chinese export control regimes, the law included a provision claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning even entities outside of China could be held accountable for violating its statutes.

In July 2023, China put these tools to the test,announcingnew licensing requirements limiting the export of gallium and germanium. The rules were broadly seen as retaliation against a series of landmark export controls put in place between October 2022 and July 2023 by theUnited States,Japan, andthe Netherlandsbanning the sale of leading-edge chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

China’s initial restrictions were cautious but calculated. Stopping short of an outright ban, they required gallium and germanium exporters to apply for licenses and disclose detailed end-use tracing information about their clients to China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Notably, MOFCOMemphasizedthat these measures did “not target any specific country.” Still, the move sent a powerful signal that if China’s semiconductor industry were denied Western chips and tools, China could deny the West crucial raw materials and intermediate inputs.

Beijing significantly tightened these restrictions as U.S. technology controls ramped up. In December 2024, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Securityannounceda package of expanded chip-related controls, including the addition of 140 Chinese semiconductor firms onto its Entity List. Just one day later, MOFCOMissuedan update to its own export controls which functionally banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States.

The order marked the most stringent export controls China has put in place. For the first time, the ruling asserted the long-arm jurisdiction that China built into its Export Control Law years earlier,declaringthat “any organization or individual of any country or region” would be held responsible for violating it. In effect, the rule formally outlawed the re-export or transshipment of gallium and other covered materials to the United States through third countries or territories, closing a major enforcement loophole.

Less than one month later, Beijing took its gallium export controls even further in a quiet but consequential move. On January 2, 2025, MOFCOMamendedits export control catalogue to include several of the key extraction technologies used to separate gallium metal from its host ores (generally bauxite or zinc). The addition indicates that China is now taking steps to preserve its leverage over gallium supply chains by withholding the most cost-efficient means of extracting it.

In May 2025, China escalated once again bylaunchinga coordinated interagency push to crack down on the smuggling and transshipment of restricted critical minerals. Coinciding with high-level U.S.-China trade discussions in Geneva, China’s State Export Control Work Coordination Mechanism Office convened over 10 central ministries—including MOFCOM and the Ministry of State Security (MSS)—as well as dozens of local officials to deepen enforcement over strategic mineral exports. China’s MSS has previouslypublicizedits efforts to foil gallium smuggling attempts, but the new mechanism reflects Beijing’s deepened commitment to reinforcing its emerging export control system.

The creeping expansion of China’s gallium restrictions, from limited licensing requirements and end-user controls to full on embargos and long-arm export bans, offers important clues as to how the ongoing trade war may escalate. Beijing has already shown that it can use the progression of its gallium export controls as a playbook for choking off the United States and its partners from a broader range of strategic minerals.

Initial reactions in the United States to China’s gallium export restrictions downplayed the potential for disruption. In the months following China’s first 2023 announcement of its controls, company representatives, policy analysts, and government officials expressed confidence that production lines would remain unaffected and that alternative sources would quickly come online.

Leading chipmakers and downstream manufacturersreassuredreporters and investors that their supplies were diversified, assessing that there would be “no material impact.” Citing international customs and trade data,analystspointedto the low amount of gallium products imported directly from China to the United States to suggest that dependencies were negligible. Even U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan appeared unconcerned,remarkingat a CSIS event in late 2024 that “there are other sources of . . . gallium in the world.”

Yet, these optimistic assessments obscured deeper structural vulnerabilities that have grown increasingly acute as China’s gallium controls have tightened. This analysis highlights three key developments which suggest that the risk of China’s gallium restrictions to U.S. and allied supply chains is greater than previously understood.

Since China’s export controls went into effect in August 2023, the price of gallium has diverged sharply between domestic Chinese and international markets. Within a month of the initial announcement, low-purity gallium prices in the Rotterdam exchangespikedby over 43 percent as Chinese suppliers halted shipments while applying for export licenses from MOFCOM.

This surge can be partially explained by a widespread rush by international buyers to stockpile gallium before the controls took effect. However, prices did not come back down even after demand stabilized, reflecting the impact of a supply-side squeeze caused by reduced Chinese exports of gallium.

The cost of gallium outside of China, represented by its listed price on the Rotterdam exchange, has continued to significantly diverge from domestic price points as Chinese exports have fallen. By early 2024, prices appeared to have largely decoupled into two distinct markets, with gallium sold outside of China at nearly double the price of that within China (see Figure 2). Chinese customs data helps tell the story, showing that the country’s average monthly gallium exports drop significantly after August 2023 (see Figure 3).

These trends have intensified following China’s escalation of its controls to a full-scale embargo on the U.S. market beginning in December 2024. Tighter due diligence requirements, imposed by the extraterritoriality clause in the new controls, have further reduced China’s gallium exports and caused prices to surge to record highs. By mid-December, gallium prices jumped to their highest level since 2011 and continued to climb precipitously. In May 2025, the Rotterdam price of gallium reached $687 per kg, an increase of over 150 percent over pre-control prices.

Meanwhile, gallium prices within China have fallen due a combination of domestic oversupply and a lower demand outlook triggered by a recentshiftin China’s photovoltaics industry away from technologies requiring gallium. The fact that this excess supply is not being exported, despite sky-high prices in overseas markets, reflects the seriousness of Beijing’s most recent controls.

Compelling anecdotal evidence provided by firms similarly points to a major supply crunch impacting not only U.S. companies but also major firms in allied countries like Japan and South Korea. Japanese officials and executives have expressedconcernover the impacts of China’s newly escalated licensing requirements on gallium exports, equating the rules to “some sort of declaration of economic war against the rest of the world.” South Korean sources have similarly reported to the authors that Korean firms have been forced to wait months for licenses from MOFCOM, with some being denied.

These developments confirm analysts’ worst fears about China’s ability and willingness to meaningfully constrain global access to gallium. While the full extent of the impact of these measures on sensitive production lines remains unclear, companies downstream of the gallium supply chain could soon face dire challenges. The case of Henkel, a German producer of industrial adhesives that was recently forced todeclareforce majeure on its deliveries due to disruptions from China’s restrictions of antimony, stands as a dire warning.

China’s decision to target gallium was driven by unique market dynamics that provide Beijing with an unusual degree of leverage over the mineral’s global supply. In 2024, China produced 98 percent of the world’s low-purity gallium, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS)—a figure well above its share of production of other targeted minerals such as germanium (68 percent) and antimony (48 percent). As a result of this near total monopoly, China can credibly withhold access to gallium supply from downstream markets, leaving buyers with few short-term alternatives.

The relatively small quantity of gallium consumed globally each year similarly provides China with acute leverage over markets. Annual demand for gallium is below 700 metric tons (t) internationally, a fraction of the massive markets for minerals like copper (25.9 million t) or nickel (3.1 million t). While demand for gallium is rising quickly, its comparatively small market means that even limited supply variations can have significant impacts on its global availability. This also makes gallium prices highly sensitive to minor supply adjustments, giving Beijing considerable leverage to manipulate market forces by artificially releasing or withholding flows.

China’s stranglehold over gallium supply chains is rooted in its leading position in aluminum production. Gallium is not extracted directly from the earth—instead, it is recovered as a byproduct of processing other materials, primarily bauxite (the mother ore of aluminum), with a small amount also from zinc.

As China emerged as the world’s dominant producer of aluminum over the past two decades, it also developed the scale and technical capabilities to mass-produce gallium. Leading state-owned aluminum processors like the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chalco) wereencouragedby state authorities to install the equipment needed to extract gallium from aluminum tailings. As China’s production of low-purity gallium began to explode and flood global markets around 2010, severe price fluctuations forced most of the leading non-Chinese suppliers out of the business over the following decade (see Figure 5a and 5b).

Left as virtually the only supplier in the world, China found itself with the means to translate its market dominance over gallium into geopolitical leverage in a way that few in the West saw coming.

Even firms not directly reliant on low-purity gallium could soon begin to feel the impacts of China’s restrictions. China’s direct dominance over gallium recedes further down the supply chain, diminishing to around 50 percent in the production of refined (high-purity) gallium and even less for intermediate products like gallium compounds and semiconductor wafers. Yet, these downstream inputs remain almost entirely dependent on gallium feedstock originating in China.

The relatively scant publicly available data on gallium flows has contributed to an illusion of supply chain resilience among some U.S. firms and analysts. The United States has never imported a majority of its low-purity gallium from China, creating the appearance of a diversified supply. Even after U.S. imports of Chinese gallium zeroed out following China’s 2023 export controls, the United States was still able to source imports from countries like Japan, Germany, and other partners, suggesting that it could easily route around Chinese controls. For high-purity gallium, the United States even has onedomestically basedsupplier in operation, reducing its reliance on imports.

However, China’s new export controls should complicate this sense of security. MOFCOM’s licensing system now requires importers of Chinese gallium to provide detailed end-user tracing information, and foreign firms that supply U.S. companies with gallium at any point in the supply chain risk losing access to their only viable source of raw gallium if discovered. This creates strong incentives for foreign firms to halt service to their U.S. customers, as the marginal U.S. market for gallium likely does not justify the risks involved. These dynamics are further heightened by uncertainty over the extent of China’s enforcement.

China’s expanded controls could also begin to impact the few existing alternatives to Chinese gallium feedstock, which are primarily recycling facilities that recover gallium from scrap generated via the downstream wafer substrate manufacturing process. As an example, Japan uses approximately 40 percent of domestically recovered scrap and 60 percent primary low-purity gallium from China as feedstock into its domestic refining production. Still, the production capacity at its recycling facilities is limited and relatively costly, and ultimately it remains reliant on drawdowns from existing inventories that could gradually shrink as China further withholds upstream supply.

These challenges are reflected in a detailed 2024studyby the U.S. Geological Survey—published prior to China’s updated export controls—which estimates that a full-scale Chinese embargo of gallium could cause an $8 billion hit to U.S. gross domestic product. The largest projected losses were concentrated in the semiconductor industry, underscoring the vulnerability of strategic U.S. supply chains to China’s controls.

China’s dominant position over gallium supply chains extends beyond the raw material itself. A more opaque but similarly consequential constraint lies in the specialized resin technology used to extract gallium from bauxite ore processing.

As previously mentioned, China’s dominance over gallium production is not the result of a monopoly over access to deposits—gallium is fairly abundant—but rather its unmatched ability to extract the metal at scale and at lower cost. Chinese state-backed companies have outpaced global competitors by investing in the energy-intensive, chemically complex, and environmentally taxing process of extracting gallium from the Bayer liquor created during the processing of bauxite ore.

One of the most expensive steps in this process is isolating gallium from ore tailings at volumes that make production commercially viable. Chinese firms have innovated new methods of doing this at lowered costs. In particular, the chemical company Sunresin has developed a proprietary chelating resin tailored for gallium recovery. This resin outperforms older methods in both adsorption capacity and operational lifespan, allowing producers to extract more gallium per cycle with less material degradation.

As a result of China’s dominant domestic gallium industry, Chinese firms can produce these resins with economies of scale that their overseas competitors cannot match. Chinese facilities can thus produce gallium more cheaply and further extend their dominance, creating a positive feedback loop. This high-performance resin is critical to keeping China’s production costs well below what Western producers can match.

The challenge is compounded by the fact that this resin is neither widely manufactured outside of China nor readily substitutable. Sunresin produces as much as 90 percent of the global supply. While other methods of extracting gallium exist, they are more expensive and degrade more quickly, making it difficult for non-Chinese producers to compete with China on price, even under normal market conditions.

Recognizing the strategic value of this technology, Chinese authorities in 2025 quietly expanded their export controls to include the resin itself. A Januaryupdateadded “technologies for extracting gallium metal from alumina mother liquor using ion-exchange or resin methods” (通过离子交换法、树脂法等方法从氧化铝母液中提取金属镓的技术和工艺) to MOFCOM’s export control list. Industry sources have reported that exports of the high-performance resin have ceased entirely due to these new restrictions.

For the United States and its allies, this presents a fundamental obstacle to rebuilding domestic gallium supply chains. Even with feedstock and refining infrastructure in place, producers outside of China are unlikely to achieve competitive costs without equivalent resin performance. Until incentives are put in place to support the production of high-performance resin at adequate scale, non-Chinese producers will struggle to compete.

Gallium is used within a wide range of technologies, from advanced semiconductors to light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and permanent magnets. Yet, gallium’s true importance to the United States is not reflected properly in official reporting. The USGS shows gallium consumption in the United States to be around 20 t per year. However, taking into account imports of gallium-based wafers, magnets, and LEDs, consumption is likely far higher, up to 200 t per year (see Figure 8).

Critically, gallium’s outsized importance to key defense supply chains has elevated its value as a source of strategic leverage for China. China’s decision to open its controls with gallium—rather than other more commercially important minerals—allowed it to signal its capacity to disrupt U.S. and allied defense production while avoiding broader damage to its own economy.

The importance of gallium to advanced defense systems is difficult to overstate. Gallium compounds enable a class of “wide bandgap” semiconductors that outperform silicon in extreme operating conditions. Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors, for example, can operate at higher voltages and temperatures with lower losses, making them ideal for advanced radar, electronic warfare systems, and other applications requiring efficient power conversion.

U.S. defense systems have incorporated gallium-based technology for decades, but gallium compounds have taken on an increasingly critical role. Recent improvements in GaN chip design and falling fabrication costs have brought about rapid advances in next-generation radar technology. Widespread adoption of GaN chips has enabled smaller radar modules to track targets with higher resolution at farther distances. GaN-backed modules have been integrated into the U.S. military’s most important modern radar systems, including the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 radar, the Marine Corps’ G/ATOR radar, the Army’s LTAMDS radar, the Missile Defense Agency’s AN/TPY-2 radar, and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter’s upgraded AESA radar, to name just a few.

Gallium-enabled radar systems will also play an irreplaceable role in any efforts to build a layered nationwide missile defense shield, like the “Golden Dome” proposed by President Donald Trump. For example, Lockheed’s GaN-basedLong Range Discrimination Radar—which is currentlyundergoingfield testing in Alaska and will likely go into service next year—would form a crucial layer in the system’s defense against ballistic missile attacks.

Meanwhile, the Department of Defense hasinvestedmillions of dollars in recent years to develop another emerging compound, called gallium oxide. Gallium oxide has an even wider bandgap and better performance potential than GaN, and it could form the backbone of a new generation of even more powerful and efficient defense electronic systems.

These and other technical developments have made U.S. and allied defense systems deeply reliant on technologies made with gallium. Open-source assessmentsrevealthat over 11,000 individual parts used across the U.S. Department of Defense require gallium, and nearly 85 percent of defense supply chains containing gallium are known to include at least one Chinese supplier.

Key U.S. allies and security partners, ranging from Poland to Saudi Arabia to Taiwan, have also placed orders for U.S.-built GaN-enabled radar systems in recent years. As a result, supply vulnerabilities extend beyond the United States to its most important strategic partners.

The extent to which China can derive leverage from its monopoly over gallium production fundamentally depends on how fast alternative supply sources can come online. If plants outside of China can rapidly begin or restart gallium extraction, then China’s ability to threaten global supply chains will quickly diminish. While promising initiatives are underway to establish new gallium production capabilities, decisive government action is needed to ensure these efforts are protected from China’s market manipulation.

On its face, the gallium problem appears to have a clear market solution. As China restricts global supply, the rising global price of gallium should entice new producers into the market, creating alternatives to Chinese supply. The more China uses its leverage, the less it should have left.

However, the unique market characteristics of gallium discussed in the previous section mean that this challenge is unlikely to be solved by market forces alone. With near-complete control over the floodgates of global supply, Beijing can easily manipulate gallium prices to desired levels. In practice, this means that firms seeking to enter the market cannot guarantee that the market price of gallium will remain high enough to cover production costs. If alternative suppliers appear to be ramping up production, China could suddenly flood the market, cratering prices and erasing profits.

Gallium’s small market size relative to the huge aluminum market further adds to the challenge. For a Western alumina refinery, adding a gallium side-stream would impart additional complexity and risk for only a tiny fraction of the revenue generated by its alumina production.

China’s exclusive access to the most advanced resins used to extract gallium also gives its domestic refineries a significant cost advantage, further reducing incentives for foreign firms to compete. Absent market conditions that can support the scaled production of gallium extraction resins outside of China, non-Chinese firms will likely remain at a prohibitively large cost disadvantage in primary gallium production compared with their Chinese competitors.

These factors reflect the limits of relying on market forces to respond to China’s export controls. While current market conditions (characterized by rising demand, highly constrained supply, and high prices) have spurred considerable interest from new gallium producers worldwide, a long-term solution will require sustained government action if it is to incentivize firms to enter the market and stay there.

Given these market limitations, government intervention will be necessary to ensure that short-term, long-term, and emergency requirements for gallium material can be readily met. Some U.S. government agencies have taken initial steps toward finding alternative suppliers, yet more work is needed to move beyond assessments toward concrete action. This includes taking swift action to support promising efforts by private companies.

Federal investments to expand domestic gallium production have begun to take shape. In 2024, the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI Hub) announced up to $10 million in federal funding to accelerate early-stage R&D for critical mineral extraction technologies, including gallium. This funding aims to unlock more efficient methods for gallium byproduct recovery, separation, and concentration—areas where the United States has lagged behind China’s resin-based extraction processes. The Department of Defense (DOD) has similarly begun using its Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities toprioritizeawards for gallium recovery projects.

While these are positive first steps toward meeting long-term needs, more action is required to address the immediate and short-term vulnerabilities caused by China’s tightening restrictions. For example, while the DOD maintains a National Defense Stockpile (NDS) of critical materials, thisdoes notinclude gallium. Even in the wake of China’s export controls, the Defense Logistics Agency—which manages the NDS—left gallium off its materials procurementplanfor 2025. While the NDS haslimitations, the idea of including a minimum stockpile of gallium is a low-cost insurance policy against the worst-case outcomes of China’s restrictions.

More federal support can also accelerate promising efforts that are already underway to find viable domestic supply alternatives. The Idaho National Laboratory is leading the development of integrated separation and processing systems for rare earth–rich ore bodies, such as those at the Sheep Creek deposit in Montana. Notably, recent geological assessments at Sheep Creek suggest the site contains the highest concentrations of gallium found in any known U.S. deposit. Private sector partners such as the U.S. Critical Materials Corporation areactively seekingto scale this discovery into commercial production.

Another initiative worthy of close attention is MTM Critical Metals’ pre-permittedfacilityin Texas, which aims to deploy a patent-protected process for extracting gallium from industrial scrap. Scheduled to begin operations in early 2026—an unusually rapid timeline for critical-mineral projects—the plant could provide the first domestic source of gallium recovered largely outside Chinese influence.

Importantly, MTM is reportedly negotiating binding agreements that lock in scrap feedstock and set minimum offtake prices with Indium Corporation, a leading U.S. supplier of purified gallium to semiconductor fabs. These price-floor provisions are expressly designed to shield the venture from Chinese market manipulation, offering a test case for how contractual innovation can complement technical advances in rebuilding resilient supply chains.

Meanwhile, industrial retrofit opportunities present low-hanging fruit for production scale-up. For example, Atalco’s Gramercy Refinery in Louisiana—the only operating alumina refinery in the United States—could support side-stream gallium recovery with relatively modest upgrades. Similarly, Nyrstar hastouteda $150 million effort to build a gallium and germanium processing facility at its existing zinc plant in Tennessee.

Despite these encouraging developments, warning signs prove why government backing is essential for long-term success. In October 2023, Nyrstar’s operations at its Clarksville zinc smelter—where it intended to install gallium and germanium recovery equipment—was put on indefiniteholdafter financing and engineering challenges delayed key milestones. The episode mirrors the fate of Australia’s Pinjarra gallium refinery, which was forced tocease operationsin the 1990s when low prices and a lack of policy support erased commercial margins. Both cases illustrate the importance of sustained government incentives, stable offtake contracts, and clear policy signals that strategic minerals production will be rewarded over the long term.

Rebuilding gallium supply chains at speed cannot be achieved through domestic sources alone. While establishing a reliable domestic supply is a reasonable strategic objective, it should be secondary to the urgent task of quickly developing large-scale gallium production outside of China. Ultimately, these efforts should prioritize projects that add gallium side-stream capacity at large-scale aluminum refiners, most of which are located outside of the United States.

Trusted partners in Canada, Australia, Japan, and Europe each bring unique capabilities and reserves that can narrow gaps in U.S. capacity. The recentdesignationof Australia and the United Kingdom as domestic sources for DPA funds was a critical step in leveraging allied advantages, but more international coordination with like-minded global partners is needed.

Canadaalready hosts North America’s only gallium producer, Neo Performance Materials. Although its operations are currently limited to recycling scrap inputs, it could help bridge the gap as primary production comes online. More significantly, Rio Tinto isexploringgallium recovery from alumina tailings at its Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean refinery in Quebec. If commercial-scale processing proceeds as planned, Rio Tinto could eventually supply 40 t of gallium annually—enough to meaningfully diversify North American supply.

Australiarepresents perhaps the greatest near-term opportunity for large-scale gallium production. Alumina refineries operated by South32 and Alcoa in Western Australia account for the largest such capacity outside of China, and given that gallium is recovered as a byproduct of alumina refining, these operations offer compelling economies of scale. Industry analysis suggests that building side-stream gallium recovery plants at these sites could be cost-effective and yield up to 40 t annually.

Separately, Nimy Resources isexploringsecure gallium supply chains for U.S. defense applications through a collaboration with M2i Global. The partnership reflects the value of demand-side signaling from the U.S. government to spur up-front investment from private firms.

Japan, in partnership with the United States and South Korea, has committed to strengthening critical mineral supply chains, including gallium, under a trilateral frameworkannouncedin June 2024. Japan has a long history of utilizing gallium in its advanced electronics industry and is among the largest producers of gallium outside of China. The agreement highlights the shared priority of developing enhanced refining and processing capabilities—critical steps in reducing dependence on Chinese intermediates.

Europealso shows signs of renewed momentum. Greek metals group Metlenplansto extract gallium as part of a €295 million expansion to its alumina production capacity, aiming for 50 t of gallium annually by 2027. This initiative has been designated as a strategic project under the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act, ensuring priority access to permits and financing. Meanwhile, Germany’s Stade refinery—once a major gallium producer—hasannouncedplans to restart operations by 2027, potentially adding another 40 t per year to the global supply.

However, whether these new sources of supply will be accessible to U.S. buyers will depend on the evolving global trade landscape. The Trump administration’s tenuous relationship with many traditional trading partners may cause political roadblocks, and European policymakers may seek to channel the material to their own clean-tech and defense sectors first. Proactive U.S.–EU negotiations on long-term offtake agreements will therefore be essential to lock in access before production comes fully online.

Elsewhere,Kazakhstan—while not a traditional U.S. ally or security partner—previously produced primary gallium at the Padvolar refinery up until the early 2010s. It has recently suggested that production will recommence, with a target of 15 t per year from the second half of 2026.

By doubling down on its gallium and other critical mineral restrictions, China’s leaders appear to have calculated that the country’s dominance over the global supply of minerals upstream of critical high-tech supply chains provides it with meaningful leverage over its rivals. Current trends reflect the worrying possibility that they could be right.

Ultimately, acting quickly to shore up these vulnerabilities is a critical test of U.S. and allied resilience against China’s emerging economic tool kit. Failing to respond effectively will send dangerous signals to Beijing about its ability to inflict asymmetric pain on the United States and allied economies. Fortunately, the United States and its global partners can take straightforward steps to neutralize China’s leverage.

If even a subset of the above international and domestic projects come online as planned, non-Chinese production capacity could grow by as much as 170 t—approximately 24 percent of current global supply. This would not only be sufficient to meet much of allied demand but could also help rebalance global pricing and undercut the effectiveness of China’s market manipulation.

To capitalize on these opportunities, policymakers should:

CSIS,The Drone Supply Chain War: Identifying the Chokepoints to Making a Drone,"Published December 9, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/drone-supply-chain-war-identifying-chokepoints-making-drone,"Every drone involved in the war in Ukrainedepends on China. From palm-sized quadcopters guiding artillery to long-range loitering munitions, nearly every unmanned system on both sides contains materials and components that originate in Chinese factories and refineries. Carbon fiber, rare-earth magnets, lithium-ion cells, and gallium-nitride chips are critical nodes in theChinese supply chainunderpinning the architecture of modern drone warfare.

Most policymakers andmilitary leaderstend to focus on higher-order hardware and software, fromairframestoautonomy,AI, andethics, but miss the underlying chemistry and metallurgy. The ability to sustain mass production of drones requires access tospecialized composites,alloys, andsemiconductors. In this sense, supply chain competition translates into a geopolitical battle for the raw materials needed to employ drones at scale.

Over recent decades, the United States and many allies shed capacity in mining, refining, manufacturing, and advanced fabrication. The result is a defense industrial basedeeply entangledwith adversary-controlled supply chains. China’s increasedimpositionof global export controls ondefense-relatedminerals and rare earths underscores how easily these dependencies can beweaponized. Unless the United States adapts quickly, warfighting capacity could be hamstrung by a shortage of specialized materials needed to build affordable mass.

This challenge will only grow. As future warfighting requires awider array of dronesacross air, land, and maritime domains, securing the supply chains that enable their production may determine success in a crisis. The material dependency of a modern military drone reveals five strategic vulnerabilities in structural materials, propulsion, power (batteries), sensors (semiconductors), and logistics. Mitigating these vulnerabilities before an adversary can disrupt material flows has become essential for U.S. and allied readiness.

Each of the four material categories and the logistics chain that binds them together reveals a weak link. Together, they expose how industrial dependence has become a strategic vulnerability. These vulnerabilities concentrate in five material and component domains that determine the ability to surge drone production.

Composites, magnets, batteries, semiconductors, and logistics for fielding adronepoint to a simple truth in modern warfare: Industrial resilience is combat power. Reliance on drones for joint warfighting is moot if the carbon fiber stops flowing, the magnets are embargoed, or the raw materials for batteries are unrefined. The war in Ukraine shows that drone warfare scales not through innovation alone, but through manufacturing capacity built on secure material inputs, rarely of which can be easily substituted or surged.

Closing these vulnerabilities requires a shift in how the United States views industrial power as an element of national defense. Four steps can close this gap between technological ambition and industrial fragility.

The Department of War cannot defend what it cannot see. The Pentagon stilllacks supply chain visibilitybelow its tier-one contractors. Without traceability, a “Made in America” label on a drone means nothing if its motor magnets or battery foils originate in China. A national database linking defense acquisition programs to their critical material origins would expose vulnerabilities before crises do.

Second, redundancy must replace efficiency. Efficiency made supply chains global; deterrence now requires redundancy to make them resilient. The United States should expand coproduction with allies and partners that already lead in critical minerals and advanced materials, such as Australia for rare earths, Japan and South Korea for carbon fiber, and Canada for graphite and lithium refining. A distributed network of allied fabrication and finishing plants would shield drone production from single-country shocks. TheFive Eyes modelfor intelligence sharing could become a Five Materials model for defense industry cooperation.

Third, stockpiles must shift from weapons to raw material inputs. Traditional strategic reserves focus on oil and ammunition. In a drone-saturated battlefield, the material chokepoint is upstream of manufacturing. Modest government or consortium-managed reserves of rare-earth magnets, carbon-fiber prepregs, and lithium-ion precursors could buffer production against export restrictions or surging wartime demand. These reserves need not be vast, just sufficient to buy time and capacity when it matters most.

Finally, resilience must become a doctrine to inform how the United States plans to mobilize and sustain its warfighters. The next war will not be won by who initially fields the most drones, but by who sustains building them atscale. The industrial dimension of airpower is now measured in kilograms of carbon fiber, grams of gallium, and milligrams of indium. A resilient drone supply chain is as strategic as any stealth program or artificial intelligence algorithm. Supply chain security is a foundational pillar of American deterrence.

Future U.S. warfighting will not hinge on algorithms or autonomous weapons, but on control of the materials that make mass possible. If the United States and its allies can secure the fibers, alloys, and semiconductors that power unmanned systems, they will remain resilient in a crisis. Deterrence demands resilient domestic and allied supply chains, especially as drones become central to joint warfighting. If the United States and its partners harden these supply chains now, deterrence will hold. If not, a single foreign factory could become a single point of failure.

CSIS,Experts React: Unpacking the Trump Administration’s Plan to Win the AI Race,"Published July 25, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/experts-react-unpacking-trump-administrations-plan-win-ai-race,"Editor’s Note: Additional expert perspectives were added on July 29, 2025.

On July 23, 2025, President Donald Trump signed three executive orders (EOs) on artificial intelligence (AI). These orders came shortly after the release of the administration’s AI Action Plan and each focuses on one of three AI policy priorities: (1) building AI infrastructure, (2) diffusing U.S. AI technology globally, and (3) removing ideological bias from AI models.

The EOs and the AI Action Plan, which outlines over 100 recommendations for achieving U.S. global dominance of AI, mark the administration’s most detailed articulation of its AI policy agenda to date. In this Experts React, leading experts from CSIS share their analysis of the content and implications of these initiatives.

Navin Girishankar, President, Economic Security and Technology Department

The Trump Administration’s AI Action Plan sends a strong signal that the United States intends for leadership in artificial intelligence to serve as a source of national strength, economic self-sufficiency, and national security. The plan deserves high marks for its ambition, its full-stack focus, its emphasis on speed and scale, and its commitment to promote American AI globally.

Its scope is necessarily comprehensive. The AI stack is a composite of core elements of U.S. competitiveness—incentives for rapid innovation of frontier models and their application across government, basic research, and industry; the digital networks over which AI applications run; access to energy and skilled labor; protections against dual-use risks associated with key components such as advanced chips; and new alliances that will drive AI-related exports.

The plan, with its more than 90 actions spanning multiple departments and agencies, represents a high conviction (likely low risk) bet on AI as a general purpose technology. It is also a bet that deregulation (to a lesser extent, public-private partnerships) will deliver innovation with safety, productivity with job growth, and American AI dominance with enduring alliances.

There is good reason to expect early successes. The private sector, in particular hyperscalers, is primed with people, money, and innovative products, and a willingness to invest across components of the stack. There are also indications that state and local governments, universities, and private entities across sectors including healthcare, agriculture, logistics, and finance are poised to take advantage of what Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith calls the “golden opportunity for American AI.”

To meet its ambition, the plan will need to overcome five execution challenges.

First, the administration’s trade agenda—marked by tariff volatility—undermines stable access to critical components to the AI stack, such as semiconductors, which depend on global value chains. Similarly, recent changes in export controls on advanced chips—without a full reassessment of national security risks—raise questions about consistency and predictability for U.S. firms; this is not addressed in the plan.

Second, while investments in a homegrown AI workforce are essential, the near-term surge in labor demand for data centers, fabs, and energy projects will outstrip domestic supply, requiring a fresh approach to immigration.

Third, it will be important to pay close attention to the distributional impacts of how AI infrastructure is built and how AI applications flow through to sectors and the economy. It is reasonable to expect that job displacement, which the plan acknowledges, could be significant and will need creative solutions to address.

Fourth, with respect to U.S. global leadership, the full stack AI export package and related initiatives are innovative, but the capabilities to deliver remain dispersed across agencies. Additionally, the financial solutions lack ambition—a much larger American AI stack fund with participation of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and hyperscalers would be needed to meet the moment, given competition from China in emerging markets. There should also be an explicit U.S. company nexus on DFC projects and stronger World Bank alignment with U.S. AI standards for its projects in the Global South.

Finally, successful execution will require an uncommon level of strategic coordination—demanding a reimagined role for the National Security Council and National Economic Council to align departments and agencies, as well as public-private efforts, with urgency.

Dr. Kirti Gupta, Senior Adviser (Non-resident), Renewing American Innovation

In a pair of EOs published on July 23, the White House took decisive steps to cement the United States’ global leadership in AI, directly linking technological competitiveness with national security interests. The orders underscore the administration’s commitment to maintaining a strategic edge in emerging technologies while deepening collaboration with trusted international partners at a time when geopolitical considerations and trade barriers often muddy the waters for what is and isn’t possible for U.S. firms.

The first executive order, onPromoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stackemphasizes the importance of global markets in sustaining U.S. AI leadership. Acknowledging that adversaries are advancing their own technologies, the EO sets forth a framework to expand the global reach of U.S.-origin AI systems and reduce international reliance on competitor nations. The order calls for proposals of “full stack” AI solutions—encompassing hardware, software, data, cybersecurity, and application layers—for which federal financial support will be made available. To facilitate this effort, the EO outlines a strategy involving multilateral and country-specific partnerships aimed at promoting pro-innovation regulatory environments, enhancing data and infrastructure standards, and removing some of the technical trade barriers that hinder the competitiveness of U.S. offerings.

The second executive order, onAccelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructureaddresses a domestic bottleneck: the slow pace of permitting and construction of data centers that are vital to training and deploying AI models. In the race towards technological leadership for AI, the deployment of datacenters and supporting their energy requirements is the next critical pillar for domestic leadership, beyond the cutting-edge semiconductor AI chips such as GPUs and AI accelerators, which has been a primary focus of the current and prior administration towards developing manufacturing incentives and limiting tech-transfer to adversaries. The order prioritizes the use of federally owned land and resources and provides financial incentives—ranging from tax breaks to loans and offtake agreements—for projects meeting the threshold of “qualifying projects.” These projects must include at least $500 million in private capital commitments, reflecting a clear push towards public-private partnerships.

Together, the orders present a strategic blueprint to secure U.S. dominance in AI through both domestic infrastructure development and international technology diplomacy. While the themes are ambitious and well-aligned with long-term policy goals, much will depend on how the initiatives are implemented in practice. Execution—across funding, interagency coordination, and international engagement—remains the critical next chapter in realizing the promise of these directives.

Matt Pearl, Director, Strategic Technologies Program

In its release ofthree EOsand anAI Action Planon July 23, the Trump administration released a massive amount of text on how to advance the United States’ position in this key set of technologies. However, the primary motivating factor behind the administration’s desire for dominance—the People’s Republic of China—received only two relatively offhand mentions in the documents. Lest there be any doubt about the administration’s motivation, consider that it put great focus on advancing“a coordinated national effort to support the American AI industry by promoting the export of full-stack American AI technologies packages”—packages intended to serve as an alternative to the United States’ only true competitor in AI. Other policies, such as promoting“open-source and open-weight AI models”and bolstering critical infrastructure cybersecurity, are unfolding in the context of recent developments out of China, including the release ofDeepSeekand theSalt Typhoon hacks.

As always, the success of the Trump administration’s goal will ultimately depend on implementation. Ensuring that all the federal government’s tools—diplomacy, procurement and direct spending, regulation and deregulation (depending on what is called for), intelligence and military—are reliably and effectively leveraged will depend on implementing the policies in these documents in a consistent way, and on the ability of the White House to communicate and coordinate effectively among various departments and agencies. In this regard, it matters less whether the administration uses the National Security Council (the body that has traditionally done this work) or another avenue. The key question is whether it will fully empower a savvy group of professionals in the White House to convene the agencies and arrive at decisions regarding the implementation of the AI Action Plan, and that there will be finality to those decisions so that industry, allies and partners, and other stakeholders can adjust accordingly. There is no doubt that China will adopt a consistent, measured, and coordinated approach—whether the United States stays in the AI game will depend on whether the federal government is able to do the same.

Philip Luck, Director, Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business

The workforce provisions in the recent AI Action Plan represent an acknowledgment of AI’s potential labor market disruptions—but they remain limited in scope relative to the scale of the challenge. They provide a foundation for future development, but historical experience with automation and trade shocks suggests that without more comprehensive, better-funded, and better-coordinated efforts, many workers are likely to face significant transitions.

The plan’s workforce elements demonstrate a multifaceted approach to preparing U.S. workers for an AI-driven economy. The Department of Labor (DOL) will establish dedicated funding streams for displaced workers, while new educational initiatives will clarify tax treatment for employer-provided AI literacy programs and expand early pipeline programs in middle and high schools. Perhaps most importantly, the creation of an AI Workforce Research Hub within the DOL signals a laudable commitment to evidence-based policy making, supporting ongoing research and scenario planning that will be essential for understanding AI’s labor market impacts in real time.

While these are constructive steps, they represent an initial response to a complex challenge. Given the potential scale of AI-driven disruption, more comprehensive intervention will likely be necessary. The focus on retraining is important, but the mixed track record of similar programs suggests the need for significant funding, as well as careful design and implementation. Policymakers also need a clearer understanding of which industries and occupations face the greatest risk—especially where impacts are geographically concentrated. This reflects lessons from past disruptions caused by trade and automation.

The current approach deserves recognition for proactively addressing workforce challenges rather than treating them as secondary to innovation policy. Yet the ultimate test will be whether these foundational investments can be scaled to match the magnitude of economic transformation that widespread AI adoption may bring. Success will require sustained political commitment and resources that extend well beyond any single administration’s tenure.

James Lewis, Senior Adviser (Non-resident), Economic Security and Technology Department

The Trump administration’s AI Action Plan should be welcomed. It recognizes that the terms of global competition have changed. Technology denial and export controls won’t preserve the U.S. lead, but building the global AI infrastructure puts U.S. technology at the center of the digital economic revolution. Domestically, NIMBYism (“Not in My Backyard”) is an increasing problem for building the data centers and AI infrastructure that the digital economy needs, so clearing regulatory obstacles is indispensable.

All administrations have internal tensions and disputes. One of the three EOs takes aim at “Woke AI,” reflecting a preoccupation for this administration. It’s unnecessary, but perhaps part of some internal political trade to win support for the rest of the package.

The Action Plan is not for the faint of heart. It does not obsess over potential (and often imaginary) AI risks. For perspective, remember that the Doomsday Clock has said we are only minutes away from nuclear annihilation—and had been saying so for the last 78 years. What isn’t exaggerated is that the country that leads in building AI will be the center of the global economy (the administration prefers the word “dominate”). The Action Plan is an opportunity to strengthen U.S. leadership in AI while protecting national security with reasonable restraints on chip manufacturing. Other nations will develop AI with or without U.S. help, so the strategic imperative recognized by the Action Plan is to ensure that U.S. companies, rather than competitors in China, capture the expanding global market for AI services and infrastructure.

Leslie Abrahams, Deputy Director and Senior Fellow, Energy Security and Climate Change Program

The AI Action Plan and its accompanying EO,Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure, correctly identify electricity as a key AI bottleneck but misguidedly prioritize speed of energy infrastructure for AI expansion above all else. The energy demand of data centers has thrust electricity to the center of U.S. economic competitiveness, requiring revised permitting and financing approaches to expanding the grid. However, load growth from AI is just the beginning; additional demand from advanced manufacturing and electrification could as much as double U.S. electricity demand by 2050. The challenge is therefore not just to meet AI energy demand, but to strategically build a robust, affordable, and reliable power system that will secure long-term, sustained U.S. competitiveness. This requires a holistic approach to grid expansion, rather than a carve-out for an individual technology sector.

Environmental and climate impacts aside, by offering discounted federal land and accelerated permitting, this approach reduces costs for tech companies while leaving ratepayers to foot the bill when utilities distribute the capital costs across all customers. The EO also takes away federal funding from potential energy projects that could have benefited the broader customer base; instead of providing loans and grants for projects where they are needed most, the EO calls for agencies to reprioritize available public financial support to specifically build AI-related infrastructure. This again subsidizes energy projects for hyperscalers—which have the means and the motivation to pay high costs for electricity—rather than financing infrastructure projects that would more cost-effectively address grid congestion system-wide.

While accelerated permitting, among other reforms, will be necessary to meet growing U.S. energy demand, this EO lacks guardrails to ensure that data center developers, rather than general ratepayers, finance the generation and transmission needed to serve their loads—potentially shifting costs and reliability risks onto households and small businesses.

Sujai Shivakumar, Senior Fellow and Director, Renewing American Innovation

In today’s era of intense technological competition, the speed of innovation is a decisive advantage. Emerging technologies such as AI, robotics, and high-performance and quantum computing accelerate research and development (R&D) and production timelines—and the countries that deploy these tools first—will lead in economic competitiveness and national security. How should the United States proactively develop an integrated innovation ecosystem that combines massive computational power, seamless data flows, and interoperable robotics capabilities?

TheAI Action Plan’scall to “Invest in AI-Enabled Science” signals a step in the right direction. The plan appropriately acknowledges the transformative potential of AI to accelerate next-generation scientific discovery and correctly identifies a pressing infrastructure gap in the secure computing environments, cloud capabilities, and high-quality datasets required to support autonomous discovery systems.

To translate this vision into meaningful leadership, the United States must act strategically and at scale. A case in point is the emerging field of self-driving laboratories (SDLs), automated labs where AI and robotics work in tandem to generate and iteratively test hypotheses in real time. SDLs are already demonstrating the ability to accelerate materials discovery, capabilities with direct relevance to U.S. competitiveness in clean energy, critical minerals, and advanced manufacturing. However, at present, the United States does not have a clear funding policy or program for advancing SDLs. Total U.S. spending on SDLs is less than $50 million and is not done in a directed, programmatic manner. In contrast, Canadarecently committed$200 million to establish a national SDL research hub at the University of Toronto—the largest-ever research grant for SDLs.

If the United States intends to capture and capitalize on these breakthroughs, it must not only invest in new AI technologies but build the foundation to harness them as they get developed. Strengthening the bedrock for experimental automation and AI-enabled science starts with strategic and sustained investments and coordination in secure and scalable enabling R&D infrastructure.

Erin Murphy, Deputy Director and Senior Fellow, Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics

Pillar III of the AI Action Planenvisions the DFC—as well as the U.S. Trade Development Authority and the Export-Import Bank of the United States—playing a leading role in promoting engagement, investment, and the diffusion of U.S. technology overseas. Competing with China in the infrastructure and technology space has been a chronic problem for the United States and its partners and allies. The United States has been unable to offer competitive alternatives to the low-priced mobile devices, networks, and services that high-risk vendors like Huawei and ZTE bring to foreign countries, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. The AI Action Plan looks to the Department of Commerce to work with these financing and trade promotion agencies to source deals; however, that is easier said than done, especially for the DFC.

The Better Utilization of Investment Leading to Development (BUILD) Act—which was passed in 2018 and created the DFC, which launched operations in December 2019—was designed to breathe new life into the U.S. government’s efforts to engage overseas economically and to offer a counterweight to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It gave the DFC the authority to invest in development-focused, commercially viable, and private sector–led projects in low- and lower-middle-income countries. These requirements will shape where and how the DFC can invest—a task that is all the more challenging when identifying bankable private sector deals, which are few and far between in many of these countries.

The DFC can provide financing for deals, including debt and equity financing and funding support for AI infrastructure, such as power generation and electrification projects, on-lending to tech companies, and the construction of data centers. The DFC has supported a handful of information and communications technology projects, includingdata centers for digital communications in Africa. It has also supported several energy projects, includingsolar power projects in Indiaandtransmission and grid systems for reliable power supply in Mozambique. Congress has the opportunity to provide further flexibility to the DFC to support the AI Action Plan with thereauthorization due this October; Congress can provide theequity fixnecessary for the DFC to deploy this tool more effectively, raise the spending cap, and broaden the countries where the DFC can provide financial support.

The Trump administration’s recently published Winning the Race America’s AI Action Plan and related EO—Promoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stack—direct a process of up to 180 days to obtain and evaluate proposals from industry consortia for full-stack AI export packages and recommended export control actions. The plan and EO raise several implementation issues and questions, including the following.

Timing

Process

Enforcement

Tools

Plurilateral Controls

Noam Unger, Director, Sustainable Development and Resilience Initiative and Senior Fellow, Project on Prosperity and Development, and Madeleine McLean, Program Manager and Research Associate, Sustainable Development and Resilience Initiative and Project on Prosperity and Development

The Trump administration is right tofocuson promoting the export of full-stack AI technology packages to “decrease international dependence on AI technologies” developed by adversaries. The geopolitical competition between the United States and its adversaries, however, is often contested within developing countries across the Global South. This is an especially important consideration in light ofprojectedlabor demographics and growth, particularly across Africa.

What the newly released approach currently lacks is an acknowledgement of the potential for AI to either expand or narrow the digital divide, and the rising demand across developing countries to build out their own sovereign AI systems. Already, innovators in less advanced economies are building tools to address local challenges—ranging fromchatbotsprogrammed to support student learning toplatformsproviding agricultural advice to local farmers—often with the help of U.S. AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Meta’s Llama. The United States must capitalize on—and strengthen—such partnerships.

The order to promote exports is also silent on the stark capacity limits in many active and potential partner countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Limited energy access, infrastructure, and digital literacy skills pose significant challenges for many LMICs and must be addressed as part of the U.S. strategy if it is indeed going to, as the EOcontends, “ensure that American AI technologies, standards, and governance models are adopted worldwide.” An additional aspect to monitor will be whether the platforms the U.S. exports will propel models that allow local developers to modify or build upon to more accurately address local challenges.

The U.S. government’s approach needs to take these developing country factors into account at a time when the administration’s stance towards development has led to dramatic cuts. Although the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) had intentionally built expertise in engaging with Silicon Valley on scaling applications of innovative technology over the past 15 years, beginning with the creation of the Global Development Lab to support USAID missions worldwide, much of this talent and knowledge base was abruptly dismissed as associated programs are being dismantled.

In spite of such challenges, the U.S. Department of State should think through how to best include the developing country angle on promoting AI tech exports. Per the executive order, the secretary of state, in consultation with the Economic Diplomacy Action Group, is responsible for many aspects of developing and executing a new unified strategy. This will require a daunting degree of expertise and coordination with agencies like the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and the Export-Import Bank, even as the Department of State tries to sort out how to digest the remnants of U.S. foreign assistance and recover from lost capacity as a part of its own internal reorganization effort. With the elimination of the Office of the Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technologies under the current Department of State reform proposal, a realigned Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Policy is likely to play a leadership role. With regard to AI stack exports to developing countries, it will have to collaborate closely with the newly proposed under secretary for foreign assistance, humanitarian affairs and religious freedom.

LMICs are at different stages in their digital transformations, and from the guidance laid out by the White House so far, it is not clear that any of the envisioned industry-led consortia packages will engage with developing countries even as China strenuously courts such contexts with alternative open AI platforms and infrastructure packages.

AI continues to advance more quickly than policy efforts to shape it in the public interest. This unhappy reality has been true in the United States for most of the technology’s life outside of the laboratory. It remains true after the enactment of President Trump’s EOs on the technology last week.

These orders concentrate on the competition between the United States and China for dominance in this important technology—a worthy focus. But effort also needs to be made to ensure that all users of AI algorithms can identify, measure, and mitigate errors in these complex algorithms.

A fundamental message from the EOs is that all the other actors who could shape that technology in the public interest should start doing so.

Civil society may perceive that it has its hands full with all the many problems it is attending to or at least grieving in this political and strategic moment. But at least portions of it probably need to step in to shape, as much as possible, the use of this extraordinary technology.

Every user of AI in academe, in a nongovernmental organization, in a business, or in a federal agency needs to recognize that these algorithms, while truly remarkable, are vulnerable to errors of various sorts.

The technology’s reputation for complexity is well-deserved. The set of errors it is likely to cause in any substantive domain, though, is analytically tractable.

No user of AI in any substantive domain can responsibly ignore the risk of errors. Users in organizations with IT budgets—academe, federal agencies, and businesses—should insist that some of that budget be used to hire experts who can identify the risks or reality of errors in any algorithm used by the organization. These experts should help the users measure and mitigate these errors when they are found. Foundations could fund the creation of tools that are then made available to individuals to help them identify, measure, and manage errors that could affect them.

Myrecent CSIS reportmade this argument in the context of the use of algorithms by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). It warned that some algorithms could be transformative in war, reigniting classic arguments between realists, liberals, and humanitarians about the acceptability of warfare with the remarkable speed and precision putatively available with AI.

It also warned that are a host of generic errors that could afflict AI algorithms in any domain, but that could have particularly tragic effects with the use of algorithms in war.

The report acknowledges the tremendous benefits that AI algorithms could bring to U.S. warfighting capabilities but urges that the incorporation of AI be accompanied by the development and use of analytical tools to ensure that DOD’s use of AI is consistent with military effectiveness and law of war compliance.

The DOD may have a unique use case for AI algorithms. But there are many high-consequence uses of algorithms in society today, and surely every user should be armed with some tools to ensure that they do not confront these mighty algorithms alone.

CSIS,Reflecting on the Commerce Department’s Role in Protecting Critical Technology with Under Secretary of Commerce Alan Estevez,"Transcript — January 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/reflecting-commerce-departments-role-protecting-critical-technology-under-secretary,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on January 14, 2024.Watch the full video here.

Navin Girishankar: Good afternoon. I’m Navin Girishankar, the president of the Economic Security and Technology Department at CSIS. Welcome to today’s event. I am delighted to host Alan Estevez, Undersecretary of Commerce at the Bureau of Industry and Security. Former colleague. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Alan over the last three years. And just absolutely delighted that he’ll be joining us here today.

And obviously you may have heard that export controls is in the news recently. I think more so today and maybe even tomorrow, I don’t know. But Alan has really overseen BIS during a period of a meaningful and significant evolution of export controls, as many of you know. And over the years, seen him work tirelessly with his team, oftentimes below the radar screen, working hard to ensure security of U.S. markets, products, sensitive technologies. And so really want to salute Alan and his team before they come up here.

Probably as he’s kept us busy at tracking what the administration has been doing, no one has been more focused on it and busier than Greg Allen, who is the director of our Wadhwani AI Center. And so I think no one better to have this conversation with Alan than Greg. And so with that, let me ask Alan to come up and really just thank him for making time available today. (Applause.)

Alan Estevez: OK, thank you for that very nice introduction, Navin.

You know, when I used to run logistics for the Department of Defense, and I would talk about supply chain, people used to, like, kind of go into this kind of glaze. Like, he’s talking about supply chain again? I don’t want to hear about supply chain. Fast forward, you know, during COVID, everyone wanted to talk about supply chain. And they still do. I don’t know what it was like when you were – had my job, Eric, or when – Bill Reinsch is somewhere in here – had my job. But, you know, I used to kind of glaze over when people talked about export controls too. (Laughter.) And I don’t think that’s the case anymore. At least we’re trying not to make it the case. And, you know, we’ve had a little bit of the cadence over the last couple of weeks of – I think this week it’s a rule or two a day related to some important things around artificial intelligence and our ability to protect the nation against our adversaries.

So let me talk very briefly about a couple of things that I think we’ve accomplished in the last four years of the Biden-Harris administration – my three – almost three years in this seat leading BIS, which it has been a great honor for me to do. And then, Greg, you and I can have a wonderful chat up here about anything you want to talk about.

But if you look back over what we’ve accomplished, you know, most of the controls we’ve put on – and I’ll talk about three things, really – are controls related to the PRC or controls related to Russia. Obviously, the regular business goes on related to nuclear programs around the world or chem-bio programs around the world and those type of things. So that business has been in a pretty steady state. But our business around the PRC has gotten a lot of notice; our business around Russia has gotten a lot of notice. And we stood up a brand new office called the Office of Information Communication Technology Services, ICTS, that is also making a little bit of a splash these days. So let me talk about those three things, and again, then we’ll just jump into some Q&A because I think dialogue is way more important.

With regard to the PRC, you know, people always ask, like, what are these controls related to China? And our controls really impact the highest end of tech. So there’s lots of trade going on, but the controls that we have put on – our October 22 controls related to semiconductors; October – November 23 – I don’t know, it might have been October 23; December of last year related to semiconductors have all been about the highest end of tech, and that highest end of tech really related to artificial intelligence because – and then our rule yesterday on AI diffusion related to artificial intelligence. Because if you think about artificial intelligence from a military perspective, artificial intelligence has lots of uses for commercial applications. Artificial intelligence has some game-changing capabilities that can help all of us in our daily lives going into the future.

It also has some malicious applications to it. You know, most people think about the deep fakes and, you know, news-related issues around artificial intelligence. But artificial intelligence for, like, military application enhances command and control, enhances targeting, enhances logistics, enhances autonomous warfare. All those things are very worrisome. On top of that, artificial intelligence at the next generations of models – not the models that are there today – are going to facilitate cyber capabilities – cyber warfare capabilities. It’s going to facilitate biological development capabilities. So all sorts of things that artificial intelligence can be used for, for purposes that go against the national security interests of the United States and its allies.

So the controls we put on semiconductors and semiconductor equipment going to the PRC have all been about impeding the PRC’s ability to build the large-language models that can threaten the United States and its allies from a national security perspective.

Now, I’m a realistic person. Will we stop the PRC from developing models? The answer there is, you know, no. The realistic answer is no. Over time the PRC will – they have very smart people, very good engineers; many of them went to the same universities that our top engineers went to, and they’re going to work around, develop new methods and new techniques and new technologies. But our point is to not them let our state-of-the-art technology to advance their capabilities, and that’s what our focus has been there. And I would argue that no administration has been more focused and tougher on the PRC with relationship to that.

And I will give credit to the previous Trump administration for starting some of the things that we took on that path. But we really took it to another level – industrialized it, if you would – issuing country-wide controls versus specific entity-focused controls. Growing the allied base around those controls have been really critical and I think have impeded the PRC’s ability to develop the highest-end chips and to develop those AI models that will threaten us in the near term.

All that said, the United States still needs to run faster, right. We still need to be focused on the innovation base of the United States. Anything that we’re doing in the export-control side is a hurdle, a bump in the path. It’s not going to be a dead stop. We need to keep out-innovating in order to remain ahead of the PRC on that.

With regard to Russia and Russia’s further invasion into Ukraine starting in 2022, you know, we always had some significant controls on Russia, but the team at BIS – you know, most of this started before I got there in April of 2022 – build a coalition of 38 nations that put significant controls on the Russian industrial base and on exports going to Russia. And we tightened those controls in conjunction with our allies around the world repeatedly. I think we have 50-plus rules, you know, multiple entity listings – I’m looking here, like, a thousand Russian entities on the entity list, 500 since the invasion, related to Russia’s ability.

Again, you know, Russia has worked around some of those controls. If you want to talk about the key component of working around those controls, you have to go back to talk about China and China’s facilitation of the Russian industrial base. Nonetheless, we have imposed costs, made it harder. That’s why you see Russia going to North Korea for weapons and soldiers, why you see Russia going to Iran for weapons and building a kind of true axis of evil, if you would, to work around.

But that doesn’t make our controls not successful. Imposing those costs and slowing down and impeding the Russian industrial base is critical to the national security of the United States, and certainly to the people of Ukraine.

Finally, on the ICTS, you know, I got to the BIS, and ICTS was about four or five people, all borrowed manpower, sitting in an office with no money, no funding; a directive to stand up this office but no money, no funding. We finally got funding in January-February of ’23. Since that time we have hired an extremely accomplished director for that office, Liz Cannon, who’s a career official, and she has built an office of about 80-plus people right now.

In the last year we put a ban on software related to Kaspersky Labs. We all know what that is. That was a virus software that is embedded on people’s laptops and then their business systems. And if you want to talk about cyber risk, talk about a software that has access to the hard operating drive of your computer and think about the risks related to that when it’s an adversarial nation-controlled piece of software.

Just today we finalized a rule related to components, key components of automobiles from the PRC or from Russia and then full-up cars that contain those components. We started off today – this rule is about passenger vehicles. We have in process some work around commercial vehicles that will build on that. Supply chains are a little different from that.

And why are we worried about cars from the PRC? If you own a car, a connected vehicle, a fairly new car – let’s say 2016 forward – and your car gets a software update, which is probably most of the people in this room have a connected vehicle – your car knows a hell of a lot about you. Your car knows probably more about you than your spouse or your friends know, because your car knows where you go all the time, as long as you’re in your car, right? That little GPS device knows where it’s going. And it’s keeping track of that, by the way. Your car probably has your phonebook in it. And your car knows who you call and, frankly, can record those calls. All that software could come in means software can go out. So there’s risk of data. There’s risk of cyber intrusion.

There’s risk that the software update to your car can say – what’s today, January 14th? The software update to your car could say, hey, on January 20th when you push that little button on your car that says start – we used to have keys. Some of us do still. The car does not start. The car becomes brick.

That’s a risk to the critical infrastructure of the United States so that’s why we are banning key components of vehicles that run the automated systems and run the software systems of automobiles that come from the PRC or related things like that.

We’ve kicked off something on drones related to the PRC and we have a number of other investigations ongoing. So that office is full up cranking. Really proud of standing that up.

The final thing I’ll note, you know, I do have an enforcement arm, and it’s not the final thing. I’ll have one thing after that. You know, enforcement is a tough business especially when enforcement used to be stop this big item from leaving the United States. Now most of the stuff that we’re protecting, frankly, a lot of it isn’t even made in the United States. It’s being covered either through allied agreements or it’s covered under something called foreign direct product rule.

That’s a much tougher thing, and a lot of it is things like semiconductors which some of the semiconductors we’re talking about are actually pretty big units. But, still, it’s much harder to control than a large CNC machine, for example.

So, you know, we stood up, along with the Department of Justice, a disruptive technology task force that has put a number of people in jail including someone got sentenced yesterday related to Russia’s support. We’ve done a number of big administrative settlements. But tough job there.

So the last thing I’ll say is BIS resources. BIS – we’ve done all this under a resourcing scheme that’s essentially been the same since 2010. My budget has essentially been flat aside from the bump up I received for the ICTS program since 2010. Received a little bit of a bump up during export control reform during Under Secretary Hirschhorn’s time. But other than that, pretty flat.

Meanwhile, you know, I don’t know if any of you look at the rules that we put out other than the headlines but they’re pretty complex damn rules, right? They’re not like 30-page rules anymore; they’re 250-page rules – if you remember the export bar, like, on making big houses for you – and they’re complex, and the licensing has doubled or more since that time because I’m controlling a lot more stuff and those licenses have become more complex.

Meanwhile, the number of people, flat. And I have an IT system that came into place even before Eric was the –

Audience Member: I had Lincoln’s computer on my desk.

Mr. Estevez: Yeah. There you go. Yeah, I’m working with McKinley’s. (Laughter.) That is not the way to run a business. I can’t say, hey, Siri, what listings did we give to an Entity Listed party either before or after? That is a manual search in my system.

So I need a new IT backbone. I need more gumshoe, as far as agents. I need more licensing officers. And I need applications – I’m going to say the word Palantir – but things like Palantir to help my agents do tracking. I need supply chain illumination tools and all sorts of other apps. And, frankly, I could use artificial intelligence in this space, too.

So it’s a wide-open space. BIS needs more resources. And I know Greg’s a big proponent of that, too, so I’m teeing you up for a question later.

And with that, Greg, let’s sit down and talk. (Applause.)

Gregory C. Allen: If you could sit on this side. Thank you.

Well, Mr. Undersecretary, thank you so much for those fabulous remarks and thank you so much for coming back to CSIS to talk in just the last couple weeks of the Biden administration, which is really not a sleepy couple of weeks in your case. You had, as you said, a rule come out yesterday, a rule come out today. I think –

Mr. Estevez: Two rules tomorrow.

Mr. Allen: Two rules tomorrow. So you’re speeding up, you’re not slowing down, across the finish line.

Mr. Estevez: Plus a massive rule at the beginning of December.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. That was no small rule, I should say.

Mr. Estevez: And I would note that, you know, whatever was going on in the world tried to make it harder, two snow days, the presidential funeral.

Mr. Allen: Yes.

Mr. Estevez: I was expecting locusts or frogs or something. (Laughter.)

Mr. Allen: And yet, you got it done. And here we are. So I want to start, if it’s OK, with you. Because I learned something about you that I didn’t know previously, which is you were not asked to take this job. You were told you were going to take this job. (Laughter.) And by one of the great luminaries of U.S. national security, the late great Ash Carter. And so I wonder if you could just tell a little bit of a story about, as you took this job, what was on your mind?

Mr. Estevez: Sure. So the way that came about was, frankly, Secretary Raimondo called me, cold called me. It was during COVID, so it was a Zoom call. She and I had about a 45-minute conversation, at the end of which she said, hey, you’re the guy. I want you to take this job. You’re ready to come on board. You know how to do this stuff. And I said, you know, secretary, I’m really comfortable here in the private sector. (Laughter.) I’ve done my time. I’ve done 36 years at DOD. I’ve served the nation. I feel good about myself. I’m good. You know, I’ll give you some ideas. And she said, yeah, that’s the wrong answer. We’re staying on this call until you say yes. (Laughter.)

And I did say yes by the end of that call. And then the next day, Ash Carter, one of my – you know, a great friend, God rest his soul, great mentor to me, former Secretary of Defense, and I worked for him in a number of other jobs, called me and said: Hey, Alan. Gina Raimondo called me. She wants you to take that BIS job. You’re taking that job. Click. (Laughter.)

Mr. Allen: Which is very classic Dr. Carter. But I think it’s worth pointing out, and this is something that Bill Reinsch, my colleague here at CSIS, has pointed out, is – and we’re in a presidential transition moment here right now. So there’s the list of jobs, you know, that the new president is responsible for appointing. That list of jobs is called the Plum Book. But there’s a less well-known list of jobs, which is called the Prune Book, which are the jobs that are really important and no fun at all to have. And BIS undersecretary is under that job. (Laughter.) And I’m glad to see you crack a smile that you maintain, you know, a good demeanor as well.

Mr. Estevez: Throw some water on it, it becomes a plum. (Laughter.)

Mr. Allen: Yeah. But really, one of the hardest jobs in government, I think one of the hardest times to have one of the hardest jobs in government. And so, on behalf of all of CSIS, I want to thank you for your years of public service in this job and your many prior jobs.

I want to now start by taking us back to October 2022. This was when the October 7th, 2022, export controls came out on artificial intelligence and semiconductors. I thought it was a landmark moment in the history of international relations. Really, I think probably the second-most important thing in foreign policy that happened that year, other than Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And I want to take us to a statement by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said, “We are at an inflection point. The post-Cold War world has come to an end and there is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.”

And this was only 10 days after the export controls policy came out. And he really seemed to say that with this new export control policy we are sort of bookending the end of the post-Cold War era, and this new policy is sort of the starting point for what our approach is going to be writ large. And so I want to ask, you know, do you see your own work in those same historic terms? And, of course, this has a – this has a resourcing follow up question, but let’s just start there, your reaction to that.

Mr. Estevez: Yeah, look, I think – I’m a modest person, but I think the work that BIS has done is critically important at this time. This is not, you know, to use a commercial analogy here, your grandfather’s BIS, right?

Mr. Allen: Yeah. Maybe the computers, but not the work.

Mr. Estevez: (Laughs.) Exactly right. We are certainly hot, dead center in national security strategy. The amount of time I’ve spent in the Situation Room is way more than I expected in this job. And that’s because technology is critically important in this space. So, you know, look, when I’m sitting on a Sunday afternoon on a phone call with the Secretary of Commerce and the National Security Advisor talking about the minutia of the parameter of some export control rule, you say, huh, this is probably really important stuff. Shouldn’t Jake be doing something else? But it is critically important. And I think we’ve risen to meet that moment.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. I certainly agree, and I think – now, that policy, in addition to making new big houses for the lawyers who service this work, as you mentioned in your remarks, was, you know, followed on. And so I’d like to – sticking with the AI and semiconductor story here, if you could just sort of explain your own looking back sense of what was the big moment that – what happened in October 2022, what happened in October 2023, what happened in December 2024, and what’s happened in January –just yesterday, in fact, with this diffusion rule.

Mr. Estevez: Yeah.

Mr. Allen: What do you see as the stairstep in your own thinking and in U.S. policy?

Mr. Estevez: Sure. So let me start off with what’s consistent across all those, and it goes back to what I was saying from the podium, that we were focused on the risks related to artificial intelligence – the national security risk related to artificial intelligence and the need to put some control on that and certainly to control adversarial use of that against us.

And again, you know, in the case of the PRC, in the case of any nation that we have controls on, they’re sovereign nations. PRC can modernize their military; they just shouldn’t be doing it with our stuff.

Mr. Allen: (Laughs.) Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: And so that’s point one. So you have a threat vector here, and you know, consistency of what’s across that threat vector. And you know, I’ll throw in the small yard-high fence thing and what does that mean, because people are going to always ask me, well, what’s the definition of the yard? Well, the yard is really defined by the threat and the technology. And technology moves, right? So when we put out that October ’22 rule was before the explosion of ChatGPT –

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: – when everyone said, oh, this is a real thing, not some like “woo-woo,” you know, like, deep inside JAIC or where you came from.

Mr. Allen Yeah, yeah.

Mr. Estevez: – which needs to do more, too, by the way. (Laughs.)

Mr. Allen: We had some fun stuff but we did not have ChatGPT.

Mr. Estevez: And so, you know, we put out that rule related to protection of the most advanced semiconductors that were on the market at that time and the tools to make those semiconductors. Well, two things occur in between there. One, we didn’t get the parameter exactly right.

Mr. Allen: Yep.

Mr. Estevez: You know, one of the things I noticed when I came into this job is that I’ve never made a semiconductor, and frankly no one on my team had ever made a semiconductor. I shouldn’t say no one; there’s probably someone. But, you know, suddenly I had this CHIPS office where I had people who actually did make semiconductors.

Mr. Allen: Yes.

Mr. Estevez: So you start talking to them, you start talking to the companies. You know, people say we’re too close to industry talking to the companies – in order to understand, like, what makes a good artificial intelligence GPU, I spend a lot of time with people who either built you know, the model – big, large language models – you know, people at OpenAI or Anthropic or Inflection – you know, name your AI company du jour – or I talk to Nvidia and AMD and Intel and the people who make chips. So to, like Samsung, you know, how do you make a good chip and what goes into that?

So we realized we had the parameter wrong. So we adjusted the parameter – I think that parameter came out much closer to like –

Mr. Allen: Yeah, this is moving from processor speed and interconnect speed to total processing power. Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: That’s correct.

Mr. Allen: Yep.

Mr. Estevez: And so that was the October 23 rule.

All right. The PRC is not stagnant. They’re saying, OK, I can’t get an EUV machine; I can’t get the highest DUV machine because I have countrywide bans, and you know, there’s controls on certain fabs. Somewhere I’m going to stand up fabs and I’m going to start doing some techniques that may not be economically viable – multi-patterning –

Mr. Allen: Yep.

Mr. Estevez: – that TSMC had tried in the 2010s and then waited for EUV machines before they went down to that level – that, you know, if you were going to do it from an economic standpoint, you’d fall on your face; but if you’re subsidized and the economy of scale isn’t your worry – I can, like, produce chips. I can’t produce high yields but I can produce a lot of chips at low yields.

We said, OK, what do we need to do about that? So, you know, again, the adversary has a vote, just like the enemy has a vote on a battlefield. And we made adjustments, and those adjustments were reflected in the December 2 rule of this year.

Mr. Allen: Of last year.

Mr. Estevez: Yeah, of last year, of last year.

The AI diffusion rule that we put out yesterday is again about, you know, the tech ecosystem around artificial intelligence and the data centers and how those data centers are being used and how do you protect model weights around the world, because model weights can be stolen, one; two, people can access models and then do their inference back in their own country around those models. They’re probably not going to do any training. You know, if some adversarial country wanted to do nuclear modeling on a(n) open-source model, like, have at it. I mean, I think we would probably want to look at that.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: But what we did in the diffusion rule is I think – it was some hard work. We set it so that, you know, normal business can go on. Almost anywhere in the world you can access a large number of chips, some with the license capability, some through VEUs, some through government-to-government agreements, and some through working with U.S. companies. There’s only a few companies that hyperscale around the globe anyway.

Mr. Allen: Right.

Mr. Estevez: And so we set it. And then, you know, if you’re buying low volumes of chips, like you’re a bank building your server farm for your own calculations, that’s not going to register. That doesn’t even require a license.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: Seventeen hundred the cap there. And so, again, it’s protecting against the nefarious uses of artificial intelligence that our adversaries would try, to do some security requirements around data centers around the world that go into the approval of a VEU-type thing, and allowing commercial trade to go on.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. So I want to – I think that’s an excellent summary of sort of the action process and the learning process of the Biden administration across AI and semiconductor export controls. I want to just talk a little bit about, you know, what you see as the impact of these controls. And I’ll give a few datapoints that I think are especially salient.

So, number one, the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek, which is usually regarded as the best frontier AI model developer of China, at least at the present moment, they released an open-source model that is, in some performance parameters, really competitive, you know, with what’s coming out of Meta or what’s coming out with everything else.

But I think one of the really important datapoints there is that this model was trained on the H-800s, so exactly as you said, you know, getting the performance threshold for the chip restrictions wrong the first time around.

And what does the future look like for a company like DeepSeek? The CEO of DeepSeek, in a recent interview, said the number one challenge facing his company is not financing. It’s not human resources. It is those export controls. That is the biggest challenge facing the future of his company, which I thought was really interesting.

And then there’s the question about, you know, not just buying chips but making chips locally in China. I had the opportunity to speak to somebody who was, you know, talking to folks in Huawei’s supply chain in the very recent past. And what they said is that SMIC, Huawei’s preferred logic chip manufacturer for AI chips, is still stuck making fewer than 20,000 wafers per month.

And the bottleneck in their process is exactly as you predicted, deposition and etching equipment that is on U.S. export controls, which I think is a phenomenal outcome. And it’s not just that they’re bottlenecked; they can’t scale up production in terms of wafers per month. But the yields are dreadful. They’re stuck at, as of November 2024, 20 percent of the chips that come off that line are actually usable.

And so I think, as a direct result of these export controls that we’ve put in place today, you know, the alternative to American AI chips is not Chinese AI chips. The alternative to American AI chips is no AI chips. And I think those are really strong datapoints as an endorsement of the actions that you’ve taken.

I just want to ask whether or not you agree and whether or not there’s anything else that’s salient in your mind as you think about scoring your own homework.

Mr. Estevez: I do agree. But again, I’m always hesitant to say we’re doing well –

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: – because that’s the road to oblivion

Mr. Allen: Yeah. (Laughs.) Only the paranoid survive, as the chip industry often says.

Mr. Estevez: If you’re taking my job, you should be a paranoid schizophrenic for sure.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. (Laughs.)

Mr. Estevez: But anyone who works in Washington, as you know, has to, like, live in the paranoid, at least in the national-security space.

Mr. Allen: Absolutely.

Mr. Estevez: If you’re not living in a paranoid bubble, then you’re in the wrong business.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: You know, as I was talking about cars – no one should get into their car, right – (laughs) – showed.

So I think we’re doing well. But I think you can’t rest on that; you have to be vigilant. Give them a lot of credit for, as I said earlier, you know, smart engineers, smart capability, and they’re pouring a lot of money into this. So where the next breakthrough can come from, it could come from there; like, here’s the new machine that we weren’t expecting.

Mr. Allen: Right.

Mr. Estevez: No one wants to see a black swan.

Mr. Allen: Yeah, there’s no time to take a victory lap.

Mr. Estevez: So that gets back to the, you know, point I made, and I think Secretary Raimondo made it in one of her closing interviews, is that export controls in and of itself is not the answer to this security risk.

Mr. Allen: Necessary, but not sufficient.

Mr. Estevez: Right. Absolutely necessary things we need to do, and we should do, and I would advise my successors to continue doing those type of things. But we need to be thinking about our own innovation ecosystem and how do we expand that. And we need to think about, you know, from a DOD perspective, how do we start, you know, jumpstarting – I know, like, there’s lots – a zillion articles around this. And we could talk ad nauseam about how do you infuse DOD power around AI and –

Mr. Allen: Big news came out of that today. Oh, sorry, you didn’t mean the electricity part of it. You meant the war fighting part of it. My old life. So I want to ask about, you know, some of the criticisms of – that you’ve suffered, that BIS has suffered, that this entire strategy has suffered.

Mr. Estevez: I don’t read my criticals. (Laughter.)

Mr. Allen: But I just meant the idea that these export controls are accelerating China’s indigenization efforts, that they are strengthening the incentives to de-Americanize. And I want to ask, you know, how you react to that criticism and how it factors into your strategy.

Mr. Estevez: So I believe President Xi. I think, you know, when they put out 2015 China 2025, or whatever timeframe that was – it was around then.

Mr. Allen: Yeah, made in China 2025, yeah.

Mr. Estevez: You know, unlike here, right, central managed, constructed with weird prohibitions in that mix, they’re out doing what they want to do, right? So they’re spending a lot of money on it. I’d rather them spend money on trying to build a semiconductor sector than building a seeker and a missile. But – (laughs) – they’re pressing forward to do what they want to do. So –

Mr. Allen: And they were doing that before the export controls.

Mr. Estevez: That’s right. That goes back in time, and not just in semiconductor space, right? In other spaces too.

Mr. Allen: Right, you mentioned – you mentioned EVs.

Mr. Estevez: Look at cars. Look at –

Mr. Allen: We didn’t have any export controls on EVs and they still managed to do what they can to –

Mr. Estevez: And it’s not just EVs there. It’s any connected vehicle. My internal combustion engine car takes a software update that can make it a brick.

Mr. Allen: Right.

Mr. Estevez: So our belief is that their drive to indigenization has nothing to do with export controls. Does this irk them and drive them to, like, you know, recognize again, oh, yes, it’s lucky we’re doing this? Probably. But, you know, the readings that I read – and I’m reading a lot of readings in other rooms – indicate to us that that was the path they’re on. There’s really nothing that we’re doing that’s expediting that path.

Mr. Allen: Right. And in fact, many of the things you’re doing are making it harder, right?

Mr. Estevez: Yes, exactly right, including putting 120 Chinese indigenous toolmakers on the entity list and denying them the components they need to replicate the tools that they’re reverse engineering. (Laughs.)

Mr. Allen: So I think, you know, as you said, that the resources that China is throwing at this problem are really staggering, right? Literally in the tens of billions of dollars annually for various parts of this equation. And they are very committed to coming up with their own technology, to de-Americanizing. And they’re also quite committed to smuggling in these AI chips. And what – you know, I told you when you were here at CSIS back in, gosh, I guess December 2022, you know, it feels like the budget for Russian smugglers has 10X-ed, and the budget for Chinese smugglers has 10X-ed, and your budget has remained flat. And it just strikes me as unacceptable.

And one of the things that you said on the podium is, I need more resources. I need more resources. Which maybe sounds – makes it sound more self-interested. But you’re not going to be here in two weeks. It’s really your successor, you know, who you’re trying to advocate on behalf of.

Mr. Estevez: Well, absolutely.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: The institution needs more resources. I want my successor to be successful in that job. You know, there’s, frankly, bipartisan support for more resources. How you do that is the trick on the Hill. But we need more resources. And frankly, even the IC needs resources that are more focused on this sector than on traditional IC assessment areas.

Mr. Allen: And this is – this is one –

Mr. Estevez: And they’ll be the first people to say it. I mean, I’ve talked to David Cohen, talking to Tim Howell (sp) last night about this very topic.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. I’ve read some of the declassified CIA reports of the Cold War. And they did a lot to support enforcement of export controls. They did a lot to support enforcement of semiconductor-related export controls against the Soviet Union. And I’m, like, dust off the playbook, guys. You need to be really good at this again. You know, the BIS should be one of your top customers.

Fabulous. So in just a moment, we’re going to take questions both online and from folks in the audience. So my colleagues will be going around with a microphone. So if you want to signal your intent to ask a question, we’ll do that. But let’s start with some questions that we got online because those are already ready to go.

This one is kind of spicy, so – and you’ve already kind of addressed this to a certain extent, but I want to ask it –

Mr. Estevez: Is the answer yes or no? (Laughter.)

Mr. Allen: Well, so the – this comes from Christine McIntyre (sp), who didn’t identify her affiliation: In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo stated, “Trying to hold back China is a fool’s errand.” It appears to be in reference to semiconductor export controls. Is she calling the BIS strategy foolish? How do you respond to that?

Mr. Estevez: You know, I’ve already, like, said multiple times here we are hurdles in this space. Sometimes I feel like I’m running down an alley throwing garbage cans behind me, and unfortunately, I’ve been training to run. So, like, you know – (laughter) – because you got to run faster.

Her point in that article – and, you know, there’s a lot more context around what she said in that article – was that the money that we’re pouring into chips and into our own indigenization of chip capability for national security purposes in the United States is critical to advancing national security, not that what we’re doing in BIS is worthless. There’s no stronger advocate for resourcing BIS than Gina Raimondo.

Mr. Allen: Got it. So this gets back to the necessary but not sufficient, not on point.

Mr. Estevez: That’s exactly right.

Mr. Allen: OK. This comes from – OK, another spicy question. This comes from Peter L. Often former BIS officials become lawyers or lobbyists for companies who are advocating for weaker export controls. When is this or isn’t this ethical?

Mr. Estevez: You know, I live in Washington – (laughs) –

Mr. Allen: Yes.

Mr. Estevez: – all right, where businesses talk to the Hill who then talks to me. That’s part – that’s what businesses do. Businesses are in the business to earn a living, to make money, right? And we want an innovative sector in the United States that – I want Nvidia to be successful. I want applied –

Mr. Allen: Right. We want American companies to succeed.

Mr. Estevez: You know, I think that’s critically important for us in this ecosystem. So I have no problem with companies going and, like, not liking exactly what I’m doing. I talk to those companies all the time. They know where I stand. You know, I can’t say that – look, lawyers earn a living from clients. That’s fine, too. People deserve to have the best representation.

We make decisions based on the national security issues in front of us. You know, to me, 36 years at DOD – I think that I was quoted as saying this in a New York Times article – plus this job, national security is my North Star. I don’t know how to do it any different.

So I think that doing this is going to be critical and happens to impact the company in some way, you know, I have to make that choice. Now, if I think, huh, there’s a trade space here that I don’t want to impact the company so much that I lose the innovation space –

Mr. Allen: Right. Right.

Mr. Estevez: – then that’s a national security risk, too. So, you know, walking that tightrope trying to figure out that balance that’s what makes it a prune job. (Laughter.)

Mr. Allen: Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.

Mr. Estevez: But you have to. You know, companies talking that’s their job. It’s not unethical at all.

Mr. Allen: Got it.

This comes from Demetri Sevastopulo of the Financial Times: What should the Trump administration try to do with allies that was not possible over the last four years?

Mr. Estevez: Not possible? I think there’s lots that’s possible with allies, and I think we’ve done a pretty good job working with our allies around the –

Mr. Allen Yeah. So maybe revise the question to, you know, what is your advice here.

Mr. Estevez: Yeah. So my advice would be continue to do that work. It’s hard work. You know, allied interests don’t always align but from a national security perspective you pretty – find that there’s a good alignment, right?

When I go and visit allies, regardless of where they are, and start talking about the risks of artificial intelligence used by adversarial powers against, you know, not just us, them, they say, yeah, we need this to protect ourselves here.

And then, you know, they make their own trade balances, you know, and I don’t mean trade trade. I mean, like, where’s the line that, you know, they’re willing to press to and I think the – my advice to my successors in the Trump administration would be to continue that hard work. Foreign Direct Product Rule is a great tool in our toolbox but, you know, just willy-nilly using that is also not good balancing of interest there, right? Throwing Foreign Direct Product Rule on a country that is hosting U.S. forces that is probably at risk of adversarial missiles hitting their land may not be the best use of that tool, when you can negotiate an agreement with them.

Mr. Allen: So something that you said just sparked in me. You know, obviously right now one of the critical multilateral frameworks for export controls is the Wassenaar Arrangement. And the predecessor organization was COCOM. And one of the facts about COCOM, which was the Cold War era export controls multilateral arrangement – one of the facts that was for a long time classified but has since been declassified is that it actually was born as the economic adjunct of NATO.

And effectively, what the United States was saying is if you would like to be under the United States nuclear umbrella, if you would like to be under the United States security umbrella, you’re going to need to align with us on export controls. We don’t want you sending military relevant technology to the Soviet Union and then asking us to protect you from that same Soviet Union. And so I’m curious, you know, we talked about how Secretary Blinken has described this as the end of the post-Cold War era. And so I’m curious, you know, what do you think is the appropriate relationship between the United States, our security guarantees for allies, and our alignment on export controls with our allies.

Mr. Estevez: You know, this is – when we host a round table on this, and as a private citizen you want me to come back, I’m happy to, like, sit and talk about this for a long time. But here’s, you know, my quick take on that. You know, first of all, COCOM is a bad antecedent for this. There’s goodness in it, but economies changed from what they were in the Cold War, where I had this iron curtain over here, right, and the economies were not so intertwined, right? Obviously our economy is intertwined with China in so many different places, you know, including supply chains. And same applies to our European and our Asian allies.

The controls we put on Russia, frankly, impacted our European allies, who were willing to do it, way more than they did to us because they had a much more deeper trading relationship with Russia than we did. So it’s not about, like, you know, what our security guarantees are. I think, you know, our military alliances and our – you know, are critically important. I think they all recognize that. I also believe we need to sustain those alliances for our own good. Going it alone is not going to be an easy structure in any kind of real fight in the world. So that’s point one. But point two, so then you go on and say, OK, what do I need to control to protect ourselves? And I think they’re all willing to have that discussion with us.

Mr. Allen: Mmm hmm. That’s great. So this is sort of related. This comes from Ana Swanson of The New York Times.

Have you been in touch with the incoming Trump team? Do you have any concerns that a more unilateral, America first approach could damage the international coalitions you’ve been building against China and Russia?

Mr. Estevez: I personally have not talked to the incoming Trump team. There’s a team on the ground in Commerce who’s talking to the career guys, career officials, which is fine, about what we’ve been doing and how we’ve been doing it. The secretary certainly has talked to her potential successor, Howard Lutnick, on a number of occasions. I have talked to people who I’m pretty sure are going to be in key roles in the Trump administration, outside of, you know, official Commerce-dom. You know, I can’t say what they’re going to do. Many of them actually can’t really say exactly how it all plays out. (Laughs.) I think it’s – you know, my advice would be to sustain these alliances and build on them. And that’s the key towards true protection here.

Mr. Allen: That’s great. So if we can now go to folks who are in the audience, so my colleague, Brielle.

Q: Hi. Brett Fortnam, with Inside U.S. Trade. You mentioned that two more rules are coming out tomorrow. I was wondering if you could preview any of those for us. And I was also wondering, given, you know, the rule this morning, the rule yesterday, why is – basically, I’m curious as to the timing of these, why the rush right now? Is there a fear that the next administration wouldn’t pick up on the rulemakings, or that there’d be too much of a lag? And specific to the AI diffusion rule, I know one of the major criticisms is that there is a parallel processing that would allow China to basically get the same outcomes as it would be if it were able to get some of the restricted GPUs. I was wondering how that type of issue was taken into account.

Mr. Estevez: I’m not sure what you mean by the last one. I’m not aware of any parallel processing that would allow China access through any process that we have in that AI diffusion rule. Why rule? Let me answer the last part first, and then I’ll go to the first. Why pushing stuff out? Because, again, I’ve been in government in and out all my life. Transitions are hard times. We had a lot of stuff teed up. These are national security issues. Our assessment is that, you know, these are things that the new team – first of all, the new team, now, the AI diffusion one is 120-day period of discussion. May have plenty of time to make adjustments if they want to do it. It’s a massive rule.

But for most of these rules, there’s really a bipartisan view that these things are important. They’re national security issues. Leaving them hanging for a new team to figure out where the light switch is, how do I get in the building, where’s my PIV, you know, where’s my CAC card, who do I need to talk to about wanting to issue something, what’s the process? You can lose months to achieve the outcome. So, you know, just like I’m cleaning my desk out so that my successor will have a desk that they can feel is theirs and taking my own pictures down off the wall, I want to leave a clean slate of not hanging issues that they have to grapple with immediately so they can figure out where they want to go and do.

Mr. Allen: Yeah, I remember when I started at DOD – and this was the AI center of DOD, so, you know, not really like the – supposed to be the people who are slow in technology. I think it took me, like, three and a half weeks to get an email address. I mean, there’s just a lot of this stuff that stalls if you don’t keep your foot on the gas.

Q: Any preview on the two rules –

Mr. Estevez: Oh, the two rules. One will be related to biotech and the other is related to compliance around some of the –

Mr. Allen: Recent is-informed letters, yeah.

Mr. Estevez: I won’t talk about is-informed letters. But compliance around semiconductors.

Mr. Allen: I see. That actually, you know, you’ve jogged something in me which I wanted to ask. You know, if you look at some of the recent administrative settlements or fines that BIS has reached, there appear to be – at least based on the reporting in the news – you know, the fine is a tiny fraction of the actual sales that took place to China or elsewhere. And so I wondered if you could just sort of help us understand what is the right size for a fine, and under sort of what circumstances – like, how do you think about appropriately deterring these kinds of actions, while also rewarding companies who come forward willingly and divulge violations?

Mr. Estevez: Yeah. So let me go to the last one first. Obviously, if the company comes forward we give them all sorts of consideration on imposing, like, a breaking fine. Somebody gets significant fine, in cases – there was one recent one. I won’t name it, because I want to – you know, they self-confessed, and they worked with us. On fines for a company that we’re working through, first of all, depends on whether we thought we had a criminal case or not, which we’ve then gone through a criminal matter with the DOJ.

Mr. Allen: And this is – when you say criminal case, this is the knowledge and willful intent standards?

Mr. Estevez: Yeah, yeah.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Estevez: Second, you know, we do have some legal parameters under which we can fine, and you know what the caps are around that. And third is, like, is it worth going to court? So a $300 million settlement I thought was a pretty good settlement in that. You know, we started out at a bigger number. And that was, I thought, a pretty good number that we came out on, the Seagate fine.

Mr. Allen: Right. Great. Brielle, do you want to find somebody?

Q: Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico.

I was just wondering, how much do you think about the economic component of your work? And by that, I mean you framed everything in the context of national security, particularly as it relates to China. But we’re also, you know, in an economic competition with China. And AI and semiconductors are, you know, important sectors. And so I’m just wondering, is there also sort of an economic security component? How do you think about that in your work?

Mr. Estevez: Yeah, that should be an easy question to answer, but it’s not, because national security and economic security have, you know, a pretty good Venn diagram overlap points. My writ and the law that gives me authorities under ECRA is about national security, because my job is about focusing on national security and national security issues. So things I do are around national security, not trying to stifle the competition out there. Even when I do 232 tariffs, which fall under my writ, those are national security related tariffs.

You know, USTR just kicked off a 301 investigation on legacy chips. That’s a 301 investigation, not a national security, concern about dumping chips and, like, cutting – undercutting the marketplace on that. So that’s an economic issue.

The things we’re doing on cars are purely the things that I just talked about – the concerns of risks to your data; the concerns of turning your car either into a brick or, frankly, it could also be turned through software into a missile. You know, there’s a Julia Roberts movie where all these Teslas go run into each other.

Mr. Allen: (Laughs.)

Mr. Estevez: So, you know, that’s my job. That’s why I was asked to come do this job, because I have a national security background. And you know, my concern on the economic security side of that is, like, what’s the impact that I’m making.

Mr. Allen: Great.

Other folks in the audience who want to ask a question? She’s coming right to you.

Q: Hi. My name is Atsushi Sumikawa. I’m a master’s student at Georgetown University.

My question is about frontier model restriction announced just yesterday. As the U.S. private industrial AI producers are heavily reliant on foreign AI talents – H-1B holders from China and so on – to what – to what extent do you think enforcement will be possible?

Mr. Estevez: I think companies that, you know, want to remain in business are not out to violate the law and the regulation. I don’t see companies in their own self-interest wanting their model weights to be moved around the world unless you’re running an open-weight model such as Llama from Meta. So I think companies will do what’s necessary to protect their models.

Mr. Allen: Great.

We have an online question, and this will come as no surprise to you. This is from Karen Freifeld of Reuters: You came into BIS being grilled about export controls against Huawei not being strong enough. Since then, Huawei has only seemed to have gotten stronger. To what extent do you think U.S. policy and enforcement have failed?

Mr. Estevez: Well, I love you, Karen. (Laughter.)

Look, you know, controls are not about destroying companies, trying to put a company out of business. That’s not the way they work. Huawei is heavily subsidized by the state. State have used Huawei as their champion in a bunch of areas. So the state is going to support Huawei. So there’s nothing I can do to stop that from happening.

I think, you know, our work around slowing them down on 5G, which was the Trump administration policy around that, worked for a period of time, then it didn’t. The fact that they can put a seven-nanometer chip into a phone is not, like, a national security concern per se; it’s really, where is that chip coming from? They had, you know, a design house in HiSilicon who can design chips. I can’t impede that capability. I can’t impede where HiSilicon or Huawei was getting the chips in the Ascend 910B if they were getting them from outside of China.

Mr. Allen: And I’ve heard –

Mr. Estevez: And I think we’ve done a fine job in doing that.

Mr. Allen: Yes. I’ve heard that not just a majority, but a supermajority of all the Ascent 910B chips that have ever been made were made by TSMC, not made by SMIC, which I think highlights how the equipment controls have been effective at degrading SMIC.

Mr. Estevez: Yeah. And, you know, look, I’m not going to – TSMC, I’m known to them and has worked with us on stopping that.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Well, Undersecretary Alan Estevez, I want to thank you again for so much of your years of service both in BIS and in DOD, including those years that were given to you against your will – (laughter) – which was remarkable. But please join me in thanking Undersecretary Alan Estevez. (Applause.)

CSIS,Turning the AI Revolution into Dollar Dominance,"Published December 8, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/turning-ai-revolution-dollar-dominance,"Last month, the United States and Saudi Arabiasignedthe Strategic Artificial Intelligence Partnership. On the heels of a May 2025 agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States hasapprovedsale of leading-edge semiconductors to state-run companies in the UAE’s G42 and Saudi Arabia’s Humain. Access to American compute power will enable both Gulf countries to export AI-enabled goods and services in sectors such as autonomous logistics, precision agriculture, medical diagnostics, and finance.

The Trump administration aims to ensure that “American AI technology continues to be the gold standard worldwide,”accordingto Vice President JD Vance. But these agreements miss an essential ingredient of American power: a guarantee that AI-enabled exports generated using American chips will be invoiced and settled in dollars. Giving other countries access to compute gives them the ability to export AI-enabled goods and services globally. That throws up a critical question: in which currency will they settle that trade—dollars, renminbi, or another currency?

Claims that compute is the new oil are now commonplace, but they often overlook what makes this comparison truly powerful. A country might spend $10 billion on data-center infrastructure using American chips—a one-time capital cost. Those chips can then generate $50–100 billion annually in AI-enabled exports to third countries, including China and the Global South: for example, they may contribute to the autonomous vehicle systems that end up on tens of thousands of vehicles, or they may help a drug discovery algorithm locate a new multi-billion dollar therapeutic. The currency used to invoice and settle these exports is a critical source of global influence.

Failing to deliver a solution to this problem would be tantamount to letting the gold standard collapse without a replacement. Fortunately for Americans, in 1974, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon helped engineer the petrodollar system as a replacement for the gold standard in 1974. The United States didn’t just sell military equipment to Saudi Arabia—it anchored global energy markets to the dollar through animplicit agreementwith lasting effects and provided the fiscal capacity that helped the United States win the Cold War.

Building a compute-dollar system poses different challenges than its predecessor petrodollar arrangement. Oil is a physical commodity with clear delivery points and standardized pricing. AI-enabled services—measured in compute units like FLOPs (floating-point operations) or AI tokens—are digital, distributed, and harder to track. For instance, a diagnostic AI trained in Abu Dhabi can serve a hospital in Berlin through cloud infrastructure spanning three continents. Without explicit enforcement mechanisms, tracking currency settlement for these transactions becomes impossible.

This is where the compute-dollar system must advance beyond its predecessor: by making dollar settlement an explicit, enforceable condition of chip access rather than an implicit understanding.

First, the United States should condition access to leading-edge chips on binding commitments to settle AI-enabled exports in dollars.The Commerce Department should modify its semiconductor licensing framework to require that any country receiving leading-edge AI chips commit that all AI-enabled services exported to third countries will be settled in dollars or dollar-backed stablecoins. This isn’t foreign policy overreach—it’s standard export control practice. Recent trade agreements with Malaysia, Cambodia, Ecuador, Argentina, and Thailand already require alignment with U.S. export controls, restrictions on transactions with sanctioned entities, and investment screening mechanisms. Adding currency settlement simply extends this proven framework to the most strategic technology of the century.

Second, the United States should use dollar-backed stablecoins as the settlement mechanism.This solves the enforcement problem that didn’t exist in 1974. In July, President Trumpsignedthe GENIUS Act into law, establishing federal regulation of payment stablecoins backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries. These stablecoins provide instant, programmable settlement with automatic transparency through distributed ledger technology. When a European hospital pays for an AI diagnostic service, the transaction settles immediately in dollar-backed stablecoins, creating verifiable records and sustained demand for Treasury securities held as reserves. Stablecoins can match the speed of China’s digital yuan while maintaining the dollar peg and Treasury backing—turning distributed AI services into an engine for dollar demand rather than a vector for yuan adoption.

Third, provide an economic security umbrella—a modern complement to the Cold War-style defense umbrella.Recent U.S. trade agreements already reflect elements of such an umbrella. Malaysia receives streamlined defense trade and preferential licensing in exchange for export control alignment and sanctions cooperation. The UAE’s $1.4 trillion investment commitmentcamewith technology diversion protections. South Koreasecured$25 billion in military purchases and nuclear submarine approval. Qatar’s $38 billion security partnershipincludesAl Udeid burden-sharing.

The compute-dollar system would formalize these arrangements—for instance, offering priority access to mineral reserves critical for AI infrastructure, participation in AI safety protocols, streamlined licensing for emerging applications, and protection from Chinese economic coercion. When Beijing threatens to cut off chip access to pressure policy changes, countries with U.S. compute-dollar agreements have guaranteed alternatives.

China grasps what’s at stake. Beijing is exporting its AI stack—chips, models, and infrastructure—whilebuildingalternative payment rails via its central bank digital currency to promote yuan settlement. Chinese officials explicitly describe the digital yuan as escaping the “weaponization” of dollar-based systems—meaning U.S. sanctions power.

When a European hospital’s diagnostic AI runs on Chinese chips settled in digital yuan, Beijing can threaten to cut access to influence policy. If the digital yuan becomes the settlement standard for AI services, the United States loses hundreds of billions in sustained dollar demand. Higher Treasury borrowing costs follow. The fiscal capacity needed to fund national priorities such as the pandemic response or bipartisan legislation such as the CHIPS and Science Act erodes. Network effects around the Chinese package of AI services and payment rails make reversal impossible once established.

The alternative is straightforward: the Secretaries of Treasury, Commerce, and State should ensure that all AI chip export licenses are conditioned on verifiable commitments to settle AI exports to third countries in dollars and dollar-based stablecoins. Commerce should issue guidance within 60 days requiring currency settlement plans for all frontier chip applications. Currently, agreements with Saudi Arabia and the UAE contain no such provisions. Negotiations with South Korea, Japan, and India are ongoing and should include the same.

The petrodollar system provided 50 years of monetary advantage that helped the United States win the Cold War, manage the 2007–08 financial crisis, and fund the industrial policy now rebuilding American manufacturing. The compute-dollar system offers comparable advantage—if we architect it now. The agreements currently being negotiated leave room for further detailing. They should be finalized to ensure that America’s technology edge translates to extended monetary power.

CSIS,Unpacking the White House AI Action Plan with OSTP Director Michael Kratsios,"Transcript — July 30, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-white-house-ai-action-plan-ostp-director-michael-kratsios,"This transcript is from a CSIS event hosted on July 30, 2025.Watch the full video here.

John Hamre: OK, folks, you better hurry in. We’re going to get started here. Good morning, everybody. My name is John Hamre. And I’m the president at CSIS. And my role here is entirely ornamental. I’m only here to render honors to Michael Kratsios, and to say thank you to him. You all know that he’s a recidivist, you know, thank God. He’s back in government. He had a very distinguished tenure in the first Trump administration, and decided he’d even do it again. And we’re really fortunate to have him here. And Navin Girishankar, who heads our economic security and technology division is going to make a formal introduction.

But I wanted to take a moment to help everyone here appreciate the really important nature of what we’re – what we’re going to talk about today, and celebrate, I should say. You know, you think about the U.S. government and the legal structure around the government, it goes back 250 years. So we have a Department of Agriculture. We got a State Department. We got a Treasury Department. We now have a Defense Department, but it used to be a War Department. We have all this stuff that goes back 250 years. And so the government is structured to deal with things in those stovepipes, in those columns.

But when you get some new – profoundly new technology, like artificial intelligence, it just cuts across everything. And you cannot have a single department take the lead on designing a policy for a government for a brand new thing. This is the hardest thing a democracy does. And the only way to make that happen is to have it done in the president’s office. And then when it’s a science issue, a technology issue, it has to be led by – you know, by the most competent and capable people we have, who both are credible in the science world and also understand government. And that’s why they asked Mr. Kratsios to head up the OSTP.

Personally, I think we need a science department, you know? I think overdue. But then you got to take stuff away from other departments, and that’s where it gets too hard. So this is a remarkable feat to see a very coherent product, a framework, because the hard work is in front of us now. But this framework would not be possible in our system of government that goes back 250 years if we didn’t have OSTP. And we celebrate the fact that you’re leading it, Michael. Thank you.

Let me turn to Navin Girishankar for the introduction.

Navin Girishankar: Well, thank you, Dr. Hamre. And really delighted that you all can be here. And very, very warm welcome to Director Kratsios for coming, spending his time here, and for some of his team who briefed us this morning.

I would just add, we have a department focused on economic security and technology issues. And I think it’s very, very clear that AI is everybody’s business. The ambition, and at the same time the specificity of the plan, are really quite striking. And we’re going to hear a lot more about it today. I will simply say that, you know, Director Kratsios, for those who don’t know, is director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and senior advisor to the president. He’s the key force and – one of the key forces behind this action plan. And so this is the right conversation to have at this moment, a very consequential one. And in his previous incarnation in the previous Trump administration, he was chief technology officer for the United States and also acting undersecretary of defense for research and engineering. A long history of public service.

I would simply say, I read the plan. We’re studying it. We’re trying to understand better. I’m reminded of the Emerson quote, “Do the thing and you will have the power.” And I think when you think of the execution agenda that’s ahead of us, I do hope every success for this plan. And very interested in understanding the particulars. There’s no better person to have this conversation with Director Kratsios than Greg Allen. I believe they worked together in the past, but Greg is our senior researcher on AI and all things AI. And this is going to be a very interesting conversation. Director, I very much welcome your presence here. Thank you. (Applause.)

Gregory Allen: To be clear, they’re clapping for you, not for me. So thank you all. I’m Greg Allen. You heard Navin say that Michael and I had the privilege of working together. It’s more accurate to say that I was like an insect in the Department of Defense, and he was kind enough to take an interest in my work from time to time from his previous perch in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

And I’m reminded of what former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter – the late Ash Carter said in his memoirs about the U.S. political appointee system. You know, he said about 25 percent of political appointees are just completely out of their depth and it was a mistake to put them in the job. Fifty percent sort of muddle through. And 25 percent really nail it. And I knew from the first meeting I had with Director Kratsios that he was in that best 25 percent who really nail it. And we are grateful and privileged that he decided to return to public service, because he did have attractive alternative options and yet he forsook those for the sake of the country.

And one of the benefits of his choosing to do that is what we’re going to talk about here today, the AI Action Plan, and the three AI executive orders, and the Trump administration’s AI agenda for this second Trump administration. I could try and talk about, you know, what’s in these plans and what’s important, but who cares what I think? I think we’d all rather hear it from Michael. So to just sort of level-set for the rest of the conversation – and we’re going to get into the weeds here – what is in these orders that we all should be paying attention to?

Michael Kratsios: Well, first off, thank you, Greg, for having me. Thank you, CSIS, for putting all this together.

You know, I was very excited and lucky to work with you in the first administration. And for those of you who don’t know, Greg played an extraordinarily integral part in kind of launching the first AI efforts at the Pentagon. And the things we talk about today, JAIC and CDAO and everything that’s happened there, it all started because of this guy here. So he’s a real patriot and made a huge impact on the way we think about AI and national security.

For me, you know, last week, I think, was a big week for the United States, for the president and for the future of artificial intelligence in this country. The journey, I think, to getting to the Action Plan actually started in the first Trump administration, in Trump 45. At that time AI was not on the cover of every newspaper. It was not something everyone was talking about. Most think tanks here in Washington didn’t have people like Greg Allen writing about AI or talking about it. It was just an issue that was kind of like out there and percolating.

And we have to give a lot of credit to President Trump, who signed the first executive order in the history of the United States on artificial intelligence in February of 2019, and he set the first national strategy and launched the American AI Initiative. And again, this was at a moment when ChatGPT didn’t exist, when most people, when they thought about AI, were not thinking about chatbots or anything like that. And it was a very prescient moment where we realized that the U.S. had to lead in this.

And the main pillar or thrust of that initial AI action plan – or, you know, sorry, national strategy – that we had then was all around research-and-development leadership and how we can turbocharge the research ecosystem so that the U.S. can be the home for the next great technological discoveries.

The president then went on to announce the doubling of AI spending. And then fast-forward a few years later and all of this great research and all of this great effort that we put together as a country to work on AI sort of came to bear with the launch of ChatGPT. And then we were off to the races,

You know, we spent – the country kind of endured four years during the Trump administration – during the Biden administration – where there was a real philosophical discussion happening in Washington about the future of AI regulation and, more importantly, a very intense conversation around the hypothetical risks associated with this technology.

And if we go back to that era and we think of the first order, the first hearings that were happening on the Hill, there was a lot of debate about how much should we regulate, how much should we not regulate it, and whether or not we as a country need to be really scared about this technology.

And, you know, in my sort of 30,000-foot estimation or summarization of how the previous administration thought about these issues, fear was what led almost all of their policy decisions. It was something that was captured and manifested in the Biden AI executive order. This was, I believe, the longest executive order that President Biden signed during his term. It set very weird, arbitrary limits around pre-deployment testing of AI models. And it created sort of this fear in the AI community that the government was going to come down and overly regulate this technology.

And when we came into office, we needed to really turn the page on that. We realized that the U.S. has to lead in this technology. Our national security and our economic security are really – you know, our success there is so contingent on our ability to – is so reliant on our ability to lead in AI. And we had to put together a plan in order to deliver on that.

So the president on day one signed an executive order rescinding the Biden executive order. And three days later, on January 23rd, he signed a new executive order directing me, the national security adviser and our senior adviser for AI, David Sacks, to come up with the new AI Action Plan.

So sorry for a little background, but here we are to the plan. And I think what I found most exciting about the last six months was the level of engagement and participation from the broader American community on what we should be doing and thinking. You know, I remember you’ve done a couple of podcasts, and whenever you describe OSTP, I always love the way you think about it. We’re sort of this, like, wonky policy office that not a lot of people have heard of, but we have great experts who do important things.

One of the things we do is we put out RFIs. We put out an RFI for the community to say, hey, you know, we’re doing this AI Action Plan and we want America to win in AI. What should we be doing? And I always thought, like, hey, you know, who even checks what an RFI from this office no one’s really heard of. It was, like, you know, what’s going to happen?

We got 10,000 responses. You know, we had an insane number of responses from all walks of life in the United States. We had Hollywood stars reacting and sending letters. We had, obviously, AI companies. We had, you know, big financial services companies. We had, you know, civil society so it really showed that there was an intense interest in participating in this project. So we ingested all those and ultimately the plan came out.

So to quickly summarize it, and I want to get in the conversation, is essentially there’s three primary pillars with the overarching theme that America has to win the AI race. As I said before, as a country we have to have the most dominant technological stack in the world and that’s critically important for our national economic security.

In order to do that we have to do three things. The first is we have to lead on innovation. We have to continue to be the home for the next great technological discoveries in AI and that means creating a regulatory environment that can allow these technologies to thrive in the United States, give certainty to our AI companies that they can continue to innovate, provide opportunities for small businesses and new startups to be able to innovate in AI without being scared of state level laws, for example, and also continue to invest in the very critical R&D associated with the next discoveries.

We have to apply that AI to all sorts of things. We’ve seen today AI is extraordinarily good. Our large language models are very good at coding, for example. There’s a lot more we can do in scientific discovery, in biologics, that we need to continue to work on.

The second pillar is all about infrastructure. We know that the key ingredient to drive in the AI revolution is going to be our ability to create the right amount of electricity and also create the datacenters that are going to be – need to be powered to do all of this critical inference and training. So there’s a lot of actions in the plan and the executive orders to talk about how we can unlock it.

And the third pillar is all about AI exports. One of the most important things we need to do is make sure that the world is running on the American AI stack. We have the best chips. We have the best clouds. We have the best models. We have the best applications. Everyone in the world should be using our technology and we should make it easy for the world to use it. We want everyone in the world who’s developing AI to be using American software.

So those are the three pillars. Lots of actions under them to do it and we think by doing those three things we can win the AI race.

Mr. Allen: Amazing. So we’re here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies so I do want to start off on the international part of the conversation and the actions in here.

But before I do that I just want to commend one thing about the action plan, which is as a guy who, you know, had strategy in his title when I was at DOD, the typical government strategy document is not a strategy document, and you have a private sector background so I know you appreciate what I’m talking about.

It’s a list of nice things that they wish would happen – (laughs) – and this is an action plan. It’s actually talking about things that we’re going to do, the things that we’re going – the way in which we’re going to pursue those goals, and even a willingness to accept tradeoffs when we’re going to do this and not that, and I think that’s just entirely commendable.

So on the international part, as you said it’s all about promoting AI exports and the companion to the AI action plan element of this is, of course, the executive order, which is promoting the export of the American AI technology stack.

So this is interesting because it’s not just about an approach to promoting exports. It’s actually an idea for combining different elements of the technology stack and making it a unified package that the government is supporting.

So what was your motivation for pursuing that as a strategy for increasing exports? What was the problem you were trying to solve? Because, just to, you know, put a hypothetical out there, there’s a ton of demand for American technology all around the world.

You could – you know, somebody could make the case that, like, why do American companies need help? Like, the line is out the door and around the block for American AI technology.

So what is it – what’s the problem that you were trying to solve in this executive order and with this part of the plan?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. On the first part on the action plan the language was extraordinarily deliberate, and when we were working on this executive order during transition there was this whole debate about do we do another AI strategy – is that how we turn the page on the disaster that was a Biden EO or not, and I think that the reality was no, we want actions. We want people to begin doing these as soon as possible.

We gave ourself a tight timeline. I know six months sounds like a long time but in government time it’s not a long time, and we really pushed hard to make sure we could get it out and then we’re excited about that.

The origin of the AI export idea, I think, comes back to even to Trump 45 when I spent far too much time as, essentially, the U.S. technology minister around the world talking to fellow ministers trying to convince them to rip and replace Huawei. And I had these very, very challenging conversations where, you know, the West had technology which we perceive to be of higher quality, especially in the early years of the Huawei wars, and they still didn’t want to buy it because the U.S. just was not able to create the environment and the packages necessary to export it out. And as we were, you know, thinking about this issue over the last four years, what I kept coming back to is, the issue that we face today is even more serious than the telecommunications problem that that generally the West faces in the Global South.

If most countries around the world are running on an AI stack that isn’t American, and potentially ones of an adversary, that’s a really, really big problem. What we have is – and why I think it’s so – it’s so acute is that, over time, the way that these essentially models will operate on a government level is all the government data that a government has is going to be ingested into models to provide citizen services. Whether it’s the way you pay your taxes, whether it’s your health care records, whether it’s small things like if you want to apply to, you know, get a permit to go to national park for a campsite – all of this stuff is going to be part of – part of the AI fabric. And it would be a huge problem if the model that is finetuned to generate these AI solutions isn’t from America.

So we have to get out in front of it. And why we’re at a better position today than we were with the Huawei issues of the late 2010s is because we actually have a U.S. alternative. And this time, we have an alternative is way better. We have the best stack. We have to always remember that. We have the best chips. We have the best models. We have the best applications. So we’re at a moment of extreme strength. And we need to be able to go out there. And the world wants to run AI. They want to be able to provide AI for their people and for their citizens. And the question is, like, how do we meet our customers where they are?

And you go back to the stack question. Why do we think of it as a stack? What I generally observed over the last three or four years traveling around the world trying to get more countries to use AI is, generally, a lot of countries are interested in having AI for their people. The specifics of what that means is not necessarily always there. And we have to fill in the blanks for them. We have to show them what the potential is for AI for their people, and their country, and their economies, and make it as easy as humanly possible for them to implement it.

An American who wants to, you know, build AI, you’re going to have to go to a different cloud vendor, and you’re going to have to do some tradeoffs. And maybe you like GCP, maybe you like AWS, maybe like Azure, you kind of play off each other. Then you think about the models. You go to, all your model vendors and you choose a different model. Then you think about all your application vendors. And for, you know, CIOs or CTOs in corporate America, like, that’s your job. Like, you do that, and, you know, you get people pitted against each other and get the best price.

If you’re out in the world as a technology minister and you want to provide tech for your – for your people, that’s not a calculus that, you know, you do every day. And we as America need to make it easy for lots of folks to understand what’s available and how they can actually deploy this technology in their country. So that’s kind of the thinking – the thinking around it.

Mr. Allen: This is really interesting. And you made the explicit comparison to Huawei. And I think one of the things that China, Inc, as an approach to selling their technology stack abroad, is they really do offer turnkey solutions and try to emphasize that aspect of it. And so even though every part of the stack America might be better, the fact that China was, in this in past period, you know, willing to offer the full stack, and America basically said if you put all of our pieces together we promise it’s way more beautiful and good. But you, the customer, have to navigate that complexity of putting all the pieces together. So is it fair to say that this approach is trying to make it easier for customers to navigate that complexity? So if they have the money to buy, we will make it simple to buy, and to buy American?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. And I think it’s twofold. It’s not – if you have the money to buy, we can make it simple because we have these packages. But more importantly, what the executive order does is it activates our development finance organizations within the USG to start prioritizing export of AI. And that’s the Export-Import Bank, the Development Finance Corporation, DFC. And for years these organizations have been sort of directed by Congress to work on this sort of technology race around the world. But it’s not necessarily in their DNA.

These development organizations, for many years, have been very good at doing, sort of, like, hard infrastructure-type projects. If you want to buy a plane, if you want, you know, financing for a port, like, they know how to do that. They’ve done those deals over and over and over again. But we need to start building into that – into their thought process that technology and the stack itself – from the chips and the compute all the way up to the algorithms – is what the U.S. needs to be exporting. And we need to find a way to create attractive financing packages through that.

Mr. Allen: So you’re going to be building institutional capacity within these institutions to focus on that.

Mr. Kratsios: Yes, absolutely.

Mr. Allen: That’s amazing. So the flip side of promoting American exports is also controlling exports that we don’t want to be going to the wrong places. And the action plan really came very clearly and said: We want to strengthen enforcement of AI compute export controls. We want to strengthen enforcement of semiconductor manufacturing equipment export controls. So I know that there is a needle that you’re trying to thread with all these strategies. But I can forgive, you know, those who are casual observers of what the Trump administration is doing. And they would say, hey, there’s areas where it seems like the Trump administration is relaxing export controls. For example, recently allowing exports of the Nvidia H20 chip to proceed. But then there’s these other areas where they’re strengthening export controls. So what is it you’re trying to accomplish? And why are the basket of decisions that you’ve made sort of threading the needle that you’re trying to thread?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. What we talk about in the report, and we generally believe is that the highest-end semiconductors need to continue to be export controlled and not allowed into China. And that’s important for our ability to maintain our leadership in this race. The restrictions that we put on some of the supply chain, sort of behind the semiconductor manufacturing, some of these lithography machines, in the first Trump administration were probably one of the strongest actions that we ever took, and most effective.

Mr. Allen: The highest return on investment export control in the whole story.

Mr. Kratsios: Absolutely. And those are still in place. And the action plan continues to contemplate whether there’s other items that need to be thought about there. So for us, I think that’s kind of the dichotomy we see, is to continue to sort of make sure that the highest-end chips are not making their way into China, and also think about supply chain.

The enforcement thing is really key. And I think we need to continue to do better as a country on being able to enforce this stuff. You can have the best export controls in the books, but if you’re not able to effectively enforce them because you’re resource constrained that’s a challenge. And I know Undersecretary Kessler, who runs BIS and also Secretary Lutnick has talked about this. This is something that the Hill talks about a lot. We have to find ways to provide the tools that BIS needs to do the enforcement activities necessary.

Mr. Allen: And I just want to commend you on this, because there are certain parts of this AI Action Plan that really do reflect the OSTP role in the interagency process and the NSC role in the interagency process. There’s actions in this plan that could not have been taken at the department level. On the point about export control enforcement, something that I’ve been, you know, howling into the void about for years is connecting the intelligence community to the task of export control enforcement. Which is a role that they had during the Cold War, and then suspiciously forgot about, right, in the 1990s. And so, you know, using the White House to actually drive that kind of connection between those various agencies, I think that’s so long overdue. And I want to commend you on that.

The second thing that I was very interested to see was, on the semiconductor manufacturing equipment side, a focus on components. So not just the entire finished machines, but the key components that go into the machines. Could you just elaborate on why you think that’s important, what you’re trying to accomplish with that focus?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. So a lot of components relating to these machines are of us origin. And there’s certain export control rules you can use that, if there are certain components of these machines that are U.S., then you could sort of essentially export the whole thing. And I think that opens up a lot more opportunity and thinking strategically about the types of machines and capabilities that you want to limit the Chinese access to. I think, you know, again, we are – we are in a race. And what’s important is that we’re not necessarily cutting everything off from China. I think what we’re carefully thinking about is, as we’re doing these tradeoffs, what do we think is most important? And it continues to kind of be this balancing act. I think you saw it a bit with the H20s. But we continue, again, to kind of export the highest-end things.

Mr. Allen: Great. So H20s are chips that are going to be able to be sold legally into China under the revised policy. There’s also the chips that are being illegally sold to China via smuggling. And the Trump administration rescinded the Biden administration’s AI diffusion rule. But, at least as I understand the messaging that’s coming out of the department, they hated a lot of what was in the diffusion rule, such as country-level caps, but there was a focus on making sure that customers had appropriate protections in place to make sure that American intellectual property was protected, to make sure that chips that were sold weren’t smuggling.

And so the diffusion rule was rescinded, but my understanding is there’s going to be forthcoming guidance about what the kind of protections that need to be in place for large-scale chip transactions to happen. And, you know, President Trump, in his speech on July 23rd said that we’re going to maintain necessary protections for national security. So can you talk a little bit about where the administration is in developing what those protections are going to be? If we’re going to sell these chips, how are we going to have confidence that that customer is not a Chinese front company? Because the Financial Times recently reported that in this year alone there’s over a billion dollars of Nvidia chip exports. And Undersecretary Kessler has talked about this being a problem, smuggled chips to China. So where are you in this story?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. So I think, just to clarify on the H20, it’s not a free-for-all sale. So any sale that Nvidia wants to make to China is one that’s going to require an export license. So BIS has said publicly that they will be evaluating each of those license applications and weighing the costs and benefits.

Mr. Allen: And the traditional restrictions of no military actors, no intelligence actors, those kinds of things, will apply for those license decisions.

Mr. Kratsios: You can imagine –

Mr. Allen: Yeah, yeah.

Mr. Kratsios: – those would be contemplated.

And then the security considerations, when doing additional exports of chips around the world, I think they fall in a couple of buckets. I think the first thing that you think a lot about is the physical diffusion of the chips themselves. So, you know, I think this one probably gets more airtime than it probably should. For those of you who have ever been to a large-scale AI datacenter, you know, these aren’t chips I, like, have in my pocket. We’re not talking about, like, a bag of diamonds or something. This is like a massive rack that’s, like, tons in weight. You’re not going to just, like, put it on a forklift and, you know, back into a truck or something.

So the physical diversion of the chips themselves is something that you probably could very easily and conceivably monitor and track, which is physically just counting. Are they still there or not?

The second piece of the puzzle is around the use of these ultimate datacenters to do training runs or have – or be accessed by actors you don’t want to be. And this is where sometimes you see PRC cutouts or other companies that sort of, like, spring up, but then want to do training runs on these machines.

The thing we have to remember, especially in – you know, what are we most worried about? Are we most worried about sort of small-scale sort of inference runs for some Chinese app? Probably not. What you’re most worried about is large-scale runs that are for training, sophisticated models that you would be worried about. And those are actually pretty easy to flag. Most people aren’t doing, you know, multibillion-dollar training runs on these training clusters.

So I think between being able to have stringent and strong KYC requirements imposed on people who are operating the datacenters, married with monitoring for the scale and scope of the actual training runs, I think you’re able to kind of piece together and identify actors.

Mr. Allen: Great. Keeping with the international theme but changing gears slightly, I want to talk about regulation and governance. So Vice President Vance, in his speech at the Paris AI Action Summit back in February, was pretty harshly critical of the EU AI Act and EU technology regulatory efforts that affect American companies more broadly.

You know, the actions that the administration is taking are framed explicitly as a light-touch regulatory approach and really don’t want to, you know, throw the baby out with the bathwater as we try and ensure safety and efficacy in AI. But, at the same time, we’ve seen that some American companies have already announced that for their large-language models, for their general-purpose AI systems, they are going to abide by the EU AI Act code of practice.

So where is the administration on its thinking about how to engage with these international AI regulatory frameworks? And does that affect anything that you’re trying to accomplish in the AI Action Plan?

Mr. Kratsios: Well, the EU stuff is particularly disappointing. So the – it’s funny. If you ever look on sort of the EU Commission’s Twitter, they have a lot of pride in leading the world in tech regulations, which I find amusing. And they initiated all of this effort around the EU AI Act many years ago, before sort of large-language models are what they are today, the way we can evaluate them, the way we can think about them. They still use very sort of antiquated, sort of high-risk, low-risk buckets, all sorts of stuff. And their inability to actually implement the act itself has led to this new phase of thinking around this sort of, like, code of conduct that they want people to agree to.

And they essentially have our American companies, like, over the barrel of a gun, saying if you don’t sign up for this code of practice and this, like, much more stringent, you know, thing we haven’t really defined is going to, like, come after you, which is the EU AI Act. So I think it’s very unfortunate that they’re using these tactics. And they have a big market, so our companies want to be able to access those markets. And it’s very unfortunate to kind of see it play out.

I think what we try to do in the United States is being able to show that there is an alternative to that sort of precautionary principle-driven mode of AI regulation. And that’s what we’re building here in the United States.

You know, the key thing that – I think the very key fundamental distinction between the way that the Europeans view AI regulation and we do as administration is the Europeans continue to think of it as a singular AI regulation that is sort of horizontal and crosses everything. It is just, like, AI rules.

Mr. Allen: Computer rules. Yeah, yeah.

Mr. Kratsios: Computer rules. Yeah, an even better way to put it.

And I think the U.S. thinks about it much more as the way that you should think about AI regulation it needs to be use case sector specific, risk based, and risk based in nature. So if you think about it, the regulators at FDA who are thinking about AI-powered medical diagnostics are the ones who should be doing regulations on AI-powered medical diagnostics, not some group somewhere else in government that is doing AI regs.

And the people who are doing drones or the people who are doing autonomous vehicles or the people who are doing financial services, like, they’re the experts in regulating that industry and you can imagine this is just, like, another technology that has entered into their domain.

So Department of Transportation was regulating vehicle safety and NHTSA was regulating vehicle safety before there were even a bunch of electronics in cars, and now there are and it just grows over time. And I think, you know, yes, you could argue, you know, do they have enough capacity or understanding of this new technology to keep pace.

My argument is, like, yes, they do and they will over time get better at it, and we have to push them as experts and as industry leaders to educate them on kind of where the technology is. But that’s how you get good regulation.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. Keeping with the topic of regulation, there was a proposal that was originally in one of the drafts of the Big Beautiful Bill for a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulation. It was ultimately not included in the final version that was passed.

But there are some movements in the action plan that deal with the issue of state-level AI regulation. So can you talk a little bit about what the mechanisms you’re using are and what you’re trying to achieve?

Mr. Kratsios: So I think the president spoke about this directly in the speech where I think he – you know, he made the point that, look, having a patchwork of regulations across the entire country just doesn’t make sense. It is not pro-innovation.

If you’re a startup and you’re trying to create an AI use case and California has one law and Colorado has another one, you know, and you’re trying to figure out how you comply with both, you know, that’s really hard.

You know, if you’re a large big-tech company with a multi-trillion-dollar market cap you probably have enough lawyers to figure it out but the smaller guys probably can’t and it’s not fair to them.

And, generally, that’s where the administration position is. It’s probably smarter to try to have, if we do have AI regs they should be uniform across the country and essentially try to preempt states from being able to do that.

You know, how that plays out and how we’re able to find consensus with the Hill remains to be determined and we look forward to working with the Hill on all these issues. But I think the president was very clear on what the position of the administration is that, you know, generally, for being pro innovation you got to – you have to avoid a patchwork of state regs.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. And there’s some movements here to try and persuade the states to take a more light touch approach such as instructing the evaluators of AI-related grants at the federal level to evaluate the regulatory environment when they’re considering whether or not, you know, any given state should be receiving a grant.

That’s a very interesting, you know, kind of lever. There’s also one looking into FCC-related legal authorities. Is it fair to say that, you know, you’re looking to max out what you can do on the executive side in terms of shaping the state-level AI regulation environment?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. The two you mentioned are pretty niche, right? So it’s, like, you can see that there’s not as much as you think you could do alone from the executive branch.

Mr. Allen: Right.

Mr. Kratsios: I think the ultimate solution does require Congress and does require some sort of bipartisan action. So that’s what we’re going to try to explore, and there’s lots of thoughts about this both on our side of the aisle and on the on the Dem side.

So, hopefully, we can work together on a solution.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. So as President Trump said in his speech, we want to have rules but they have to be smart. We’ve got to get rid of some of the regulation but we want good regulation.

You know, you talked about the intersection of, you know, AI and the FDA for medical devices, of course. One area where the AI action plan actually goes into some detail is the intersection of AI and CBRN risk – CBRN risk, so chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, and also has some actions being taken around the intersection of AI and biosecurity. This is something that a lot of folks in D.C. have expressed concern about.

I should plug as a classic think-tank schlub I have a paper coming out on this topic next week on the intersection of AI and biosecurity. But I wanted to ask you, you know, what do you see as the risks that the administration is interested in on these issues, and what are the mechanisms where you’re trying to mitigate them?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah. Well, first I think I’d just – you know, I think it’s important that the federal government has a very important responsibility to be evaluating these potential risks. And just like we as a – as a government have a responsibility to the American people to think about other risks which could face – which could, you know, hurt the homeland, we need to be worrying about these things and making sure that we have the right teams in place, have the right experts at places like the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense and in the intelligence community to think through how to do evaluations on these CBRN risks.

I do think that – if you zoom out a second, I think the one thing that I just think is important to message is that we cannot allow the evaluation of these risks to be the dominant driving force of our artificial intelligence strategy and policy. And unfortunately, the previous administration, this was their guiding light. They were manically obsessed with existential risk, and they believed that the government’s sole purpose in life was to minimize that and everything else didn’t matter. And that manifested itself on its complete assault of the AI industry through the Biden executive order.

So what we do is very thoughtfully include how we should be thinking and considering this existential risk within the larger construct of American leadership in AI. And that’s why you see it as one important point within the action plan, but it’s not front and center. The action plan doesn’t exist to eliminate existential risk; that is just one thing we need to be working on in the course of a 30-page document that covers 90 other things.

But I do think it’s critically important. And why I think that – and why I do think it’s important, particularly for the federal government, is for those of you who work in the – in the evaluation space, you know, the details of how a model eval happens I think are actually, like, kind of interesting. Most people don’t really think about it. They just look at the output and they’re like, oh, this has some, like, biological risk. Well, like, how in the world did they figure out it has bio risk? So you literally have to get biological experts who, like, know this particular domain extraordinarily well, who understand what sort of – what all the risks could possibly be, and then they themselves have to, like, sit in front of a model, and ask it questions, and try to get it to say things that are dangerous or in some ways could be – could lead to something dangerous. This is a very manual, individually sort of, like, specific-to-human problem that you have to, like, work through.

And why the government is well-positioned to help here is we have experts in these space(s). There’s people who work on CBRN risks at our national labs and places like that. So I think we’re very well-equipped to be able to supply the subject matter experts to run these evals and create the testing harnesses within places like DOE to do this stuff.

Mr. Allen: Which is great. And I think in addition to the work of DOE, which is vitally important in these kind of areas, I do feel like the AI Action Plan is the clearest statement from the administration to date on what’s the future of the Center for AI Standards and Innovation.

So this is a body where in D.C. politics we’ve seen everything from this is the most important agency in the world to we need to get rid of this yesterday, and I feel like the action plan has finally said what the Trump administration’s view of CAISI’s future. So could you elaborate on what this institution is going to be doing and why you think it’s important?

Mr. Kratsios: Yes. Yeah. So CAISI was initially set up by the previous administration as the AI Safety Institute, and this was done at the same time that the Brits created their safety institute. And again, this was an era in the AI policy sort of story where everyone was obsessed with the government thinking about safety. I don’t know, no one could really define what safety was. For some people it was, you know, DEI-related issues. For other people it was, like, CBRN. For other – you know, who knows what it could be? And the Biden administration sort of created this body within NIST, which is the – which is a standards agency, to attempt to do evaluations around some of these DEI and other – and other related risks.

And I think we have tried to turn the page on that. Secretary Lutnick sort of renamed the institute into a standards institute. And I think my core thinking about it has always been, you know, it is in a standards agency. The purpose of NIST is to promulgate standards. And if we go back to the story I was telling about how you do a model eval, one of the biggest challenges that currently faces the AI industry is understanding how to measure and evaluate models is still an open scientific question. Currently, sort of the state of the art is literally having a biologist ask questions to the model and see what comes back. Like, that provides you some answer. But is that scalable? Is that something you could standardize across the entire world and create some sort of, like, coherent, multi-country understanding of what the best practices are for doing evaluations? All those are open metrology questions.

And if you think about what role does NIST have, or what role does CAISI have, it’s all about understanding the measurement science of models. And that is what we’re excited for NIST to be working on, and to be able to share with the world how you actually can measure a model. And once you do that, that’s really valuable to industry. If you’re in financial services and you want to deploy a model and make sure that, you know, client or customer data isn’t being siphoned off by the model or whatever, NIST standards around how you do a model eval could be super valuable in you being comfortable in that decision.

Mr. Allen: So a moment ago we were talking about existential risks and AI, which is something you hear a lot about in D.C. It’s something you hear a lot about in Silicon Valley. But anytime I go anywhere in this country and I talk to folks who don’t live and breathe, you know, AI policy, the issue that they want to talk about is the intersection of AI and labor. What’s this mean for my job? What’s this mean for my family? What’s this mean for the future of the economy? And this plan does some pretty interesting stuff to try and untangle, you know, what the government needs to be doing at the intersection of AI and labor. So could you please elaborate on the muscle movements in this policy?

Mr. Kratsios: Totally. So I think the first thing that I have come to appreciate over the last six months working on this is the intense amount of new labor that we need to be able to build the infrastructure necessary to power the AI economy. A big chunk of the infrastructure pillar of the action plan talks about how the Department of Labor, NSF, Department of Education, many others are going to be working together to reskill, retrain, and prepare more Americans to be able to support the infrastructure build out necessary for the AI boom.

I had the CEO of the company that’s helping build out the big Stargate project in Texas. And I asked him, kind of, what is the biggest challenge that you’re facing? And he said, I can’t get enough electricians. He said he has to fly in something like electricians from over 40 states, flying into Texas to build this project. And that’s Stargate. That was the biggest project that has been announced. And that’s not anymore. And that’s a problem that we’re seeing throughout the U.S. So the president is committed to making sure that we can retrain and prepare Americans for these very important, high-paying jobs that will support the infrastructure build out.

The second piece is around, you know, how Americans will be using artificial intelligence in the jobs that that already exist. And SBA Administrator Loeffler gave a great talk at our AI summit last Wednesday where she talked a lot about the data that her agency is seeing on how small businesses are embracing artificial intelligence. The biggest challenge that small businesses have in the U.S. is being able to find reliable employee – like, employees. And recruiting is really hard. And for them to scale and grow their businesses, AI provides incredible leverage to the people that are in these small businesses to allow them – allow them to grow.

And I would say the third thing around this issue is the effort that the president did to sign the executive order on K-12 AI education about three months ago. And why I think this is extraordinarily significant, if you think about it, we were in the middle of trying to write essentially a national strategy for the United States on AI, that was coming out in June. Yet, the president believed that we had to get an AI executive order out on K-12 education, and how critical it was to make sure that America’s students are prepared for the jobs of the future, that they are understanding how to wield and use these tools that are going to fundamentally transform the way they enter the American workforce. Whether you’re a doctor, whether you’re a lawyer, whatever you’re going to be doing, you will be using this technology to do your job. And we, as a government, have a responsibility to help America’s youth be able to prepare for the future.

Mr. Allen: Great. And you started your answer by talking about the power and electricity and datacenter build out, which is something that’s a huge focus of this executive order that’s focused on that area, but also the AI Action Plan as well. So when I think about, you know, the electrical generate – actually, let me – let me take a step back. The action plan actually opens up by talking about the space race and how we’re in a race for AI – leadership in AI, and how it really matters, and it’s strategically important.

One of the kindnesses of the space race was it lent itself to easily definable metrics. Getting to space. Putting a human in space. You know, doing an extra-vehicular spacewalk. Getting on the moon, et cetera. So as you think about this datacenter buildout, we’re talking about gigawatt datacenters. We’re talking about adding tens of new gigawatts to the grid, maybe hundreds of new gigawatts to the grid. What are the metrics that you’re looking at? Because there’s so many different actions that this plan takes, that this executive order takes, to make it easier for companies to build new electricity, to build new transformers, to build new datacenters in America. How will you know if you’re doing enough? How will you know if America is moving fast enough?

Mr. Kratsios: To me it’s making sure that, in tracking the regulations that we’ve been able to pull down or modify, to accelerate the velocity of permitting and building out of those facilities. So I will probably be tracking, over the long term, time it takes from initial application to approval and sort of shovels in the ground starting to build.

Mr. Allen: So if you think about, like, warp speed, which says, you know, it takes this long to normally develop a vaccine, we developed a vaccine in this period, you want to say it normally takes this long to get the permits for a new-build power plant –

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah.

Mr. Allen: – we want it to take – that’s what you’re going to be –

Mr. Kratsios: And that’s kind of what our hope is. I mean, I think one of the big steps that was discussed in the Action Plan is around creating – this is getting super-wonky, but categorical exclusions for AI-related buildouts under NIPA. So many of you know NIPA is like a big sort of, you know, elephant that you have to sort of deal with, I guess, when you’re trying to build in the United States.

And there are interesting ways around it where, if we can get categorical exclusions from NIPA for these large datacenters, that’s one example of accelerated. But there’s lots in there, both for how you build out the datacenters themselves, but also the power generation and transmission.

Mr. Allen: Yeah. So there’s a lot of bottlenecks in the AI buildout, because these companies – President Trump mentioned a few of the tech giants who just collectively are looking to invest $320 billion. Just to level-set folks in the audience, NASA is, like, 20 (billion dollars) to $25 billion. So we’re talking about more than 10 NASAs per year of data-center power and electrical infrastructure buildout.

I think, obviously, President Trump has a preference for that being built in America. And, you know, the Biden administration, with the diffusion rule, they tried to say we’re going to force you to build it in America by prohibiting the sale of chips elsewhere and giving you quotas for how much you had to build in America.

But, at least in the short term, you do see companies like Nvidia and its chip suppliers, TSMC, are kind of supply-constrained. You know, they can only make so many chips per month, per year. And so as these big deals go forward, some of the deals that President Trump was personally involved in negotiating with Gulf states, for example, how is the administration thinking about what’s the right approach to promoting American exports, on the one hand, which is attractive, but also promoting infrastructure spend in America, which is also attractive? How are you thinking through that tradeoff? What are you trying to navigate?

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah, I think the challenge with the Biden administration approach was they were always trying to fight the battle of, like, the moment right now and didn’t think at all about how the future would change over time.

I’ll give you two examples of that, and it relates to this. The first example was their inclusion of a compute limit of 10 to the 26th for models that needed to be essentially, you know, ones that – the risk associated with them needed to be disclosed to the Commerce Department. You know –

Mr. Allen: Yeah. A bunch of regulatory hooks kicked in when you have that power level.

Mr. Kratsios: A bunch of regulatory hooks. Right now over 33 models have been trained over that limit. That clear – that limit makes no sense. That was just, like, happened to be some number pulled out of thin air by some think tank that got sort of absorbed into the Biden ecosystem. And so that number makes no sense. So that’s not a future-proof problem.

I think, on the chips issue, I’d push back a little bit that, like, right now we’re not seeing chip constraint. Like, years ago, a few years ago, we were. And the big fear was, like, oh, you know, if we open up sales, then all these foreign buyers are just going to buy them and, like, pay out the nose for them, and the U.S. won’t have any chips.

That has not proven true. When I talk to any of the hyper-scalers here in the United States, they have the chips that they need. There’s more than enough chips for what we want to accomplish over the next couple of years. So I think we’ve already passed that problem.

So I think I’m not worried about our ability as a country to be able to have the chips that we do need. It is obviously a priority for this administration to make sure that American companies have the chips that they need to build American datacenters here in America. And we will always make sure that that’s a priority. And if we ever see that slipping for whatever reason, or a problem, we’re going to act on it. But generally speaking, that hypothetical sort of, like, chip constraint that we were seeing before is not – is not really true.

Mr. Allen: The bottlenecks you’re more focused on are electricians, permitting, those kind of bottlenecks.

Mr. Kratsios: Yes.

Mr. Allen: Yeah.

Mr. Kratsios: Yes. Yeah.

Mr. Allen: And it’s fair to say that wherever you identify bottlenecks to the buildout of this infrastructure, you want to use whatever tools you have to go after them.

Mr. Kratsios: Yes. And if anyone in the audience knows of a bottleneck or has run into one, just let me know. We’re ready to tackle it.

Mr. Allen: So I think you’ve described this package of executive orders in one of your earlier speeches as, you know, really making the most of the executive authorities available to you. But you started by saying that, you know, there are – there are some areas where you do need Congress’ help.

Mr. Kratsios: Yeah.

Mr. Allen: So could you just talk about, you know, to the extent that you are ready to talk publicly about the Trump administration’s AI legislative agenda, whether that’s in appropriations – because some of these ideas that are, you know, listed as an explore-type action, if you go forward with them, presumably would require some kind of appropriation. Other ones might be, you know, exercising authorities where additional authorities would be helpful. So what are some of the legislative priorities, to the extent that you’re ready to share at this stage?

Mr. Kratsios: You know, I don’t think we necessarily have any priorities, but I think there’s a category of work that, obviously, the Hill needs to be involved in. Anything related to preemption is something that’s going to be mostly in their court instead of ours, and we look forward to working with them to kind of think through some of those preemption issues.

Obviously, the use of – the fair-use issue of copyrighted materials in the training of large language models was something that the president brought up in the speech. That’s not – there’s not a lot the executive branch can do on that; understanding and interpreting what fair use is is now sitting in the courts. But you know, that’s obviously something that if the Hill wants to think about, you know, that’s an area that they – you know, although quite controversial, is an area that they could – they could potentially try to tackle.

I think if – you know with the reforms that we’ve made to CAISI, there is, obviously, an opportunity for the Hill to think about how to legislate on the standards institute and give it sort of statutory cover for some of the actions that we want to be doing long term.

And to me, I continue to always think about R&D funding and the way that we can prioritize AI-related – AI-related funding across NSF and lots of other agencies.

Mr. Allen: Well, Director Michael Kratsios, we’ve been so fortunate that you were willing to take time out of what I’m sure is an incredibly busy few weeks, not that you really have any calm weeks this year, but taking the time to spend it with – here with us at CSIS. And I want to congratulate you and congratulate the administration on this package of AI policies, which not only give us at CSIS a lot to think about and do but I think are really an important move for this country. So thank you and congratulations.

And please join me in thanking – (applause) –

Mr. Kratsios: Thanks for having me. (Applause.)

CSIS,London Calling: Is the U.S.-China Ceasefire Holding?,"Published July 1, 2025",https://www.csis.org/blogs/trustee-china-hand/london-calling-us-china-ceasefire-holding,"Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics>Trustee China Hand

The tentative consensus the U.S. and China reached in Geneva on May 12 began to fray almost immediately after being issued due to differing understandings of what each side had pledged to do. The Trump administration was frustrated with China’s reticence to removeexport controls on a set of seven key rare earth elements which were put in place in April, making them ostensibly a part of the agreed upon terms in Geneva. The Chinese sideclaimedthat since the export controls were aimed at addressing the potential dual-use applications of the minerals, they were compatible with international law and the agreement. Conversely, Beijingexpressed frustrationwith the U.S.’s continued tightening of export controls, includingreleased guidance on extraterritorial restrictions on Huawei’s chip sales throughout the world, including within China.

This led to a broader deterioration in the relationship, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio announcingsteps to revoke the visas of Chinese students studying in the U.S.and a series of new export controls onjet engines,ethaneand semiconductor design tools in response to China’s continued rare earth controls. This breakdown culminated in a call between Presidents Trump and Xi on June 5, where they discussed the potential collapse of the ceasefire and agreed to send negotiators to London the following week to find a resolution. The call itself had been an uncertain outcome, given differing negotiating styles – Trump’s desire to hash out deals at the head-of-state level, and Xi’s typical refusal to engage in direct discussions without pre-negotiated outcomes. TheChinese reportingnoted specifically that Xi “held phone talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at the latter’s request,” implying that China was beneficent in being open to listening to the U.S. leader’s worries.

The exact terms of what was agreed to in London remained uncertain until June 26, when both sides announced that a deal was reached between the two parties. As part of that agreement, China wouldexpedite reviews of export licenses for its rare earth export controlsin exchange for the U.S. reversing recently imposed export controls and continuing to allow Chinese students to study in the United States.

The timing of the agreement itself is notable. After negotiations in Geneva, there was a clearjoint statementreleased shortly after with takeaways on what had been agreed, even if such an understanding proved to be fleeting. It took over 20 days for the finer details to be hashed out and formed into a workable agreement after the London meeting. For that period, a variety of statements and social media posts from the President and senior administration officials served as the main outcome of the talks. This added a degree of uncertainty to the current state of the relationship. Indeed, though President Trump and CommerceSecretary Lutnickhave announced the deal was signed on June 24, the full text has yet to be released – an occurrence that is at best annoying and at worst a signpost of a worrying trend in waning transparency.

The London deal, identified through the statements from Chinese and U.S. officials, largely preserves the equilibrium reached in Geneva by addressing the primary U.S. concern: China’s rare earth export controls. The table below gives a sense of what has been stripped away or changed as a part of the Geneva and London negotiations (See Figure 1).

The meeting in London and subsequent delay in confirming a deal have demonstrated the fragility of what was agreed to in Geneva in May and also changed longstanding assumptions about how economic diplomacy between the U.S. and China is conducted. The Biden administration often sought to communicate export controls as “off the table” – an enduring feature of U.S. policy that China would have to live with. This is with the caveat that such wide-ranging negotiations with China were not a feature of the relationship under Biden in the first place. While the most consequential controls on chips remain in place, the use of seemingly intentionally fleeting controls is novel in relation to China.

China has also learned it has its own “card to play” in Trump’s parlance. While it has hinted at its role in critical supply chains with earlier export controls ongraphite,gallium, and germanium, key materials in the battery and semiconductor supply chains respectively, the most recently introduced controls on rare earths highlighted just how painful dependency on China can be. China has demonstrated its own capacity to find and use leverage, and its leadership is likely walking away with a greater awareness of their ability to impose costs and exercise agency in the bilateral relationship. That China has agreed simply to expedite approvals of export licenses for U.S. firms rather than scrap the controls completely is a sign of growing confidence in China’s own ability to exploit chokepoints.

This recent tit-for-tat has reminded both sides of an unavoidable truth – the U.S. and China are for now deeply intertwined with each other and attempts to thrash out of the ties which bind them will be painful – no matter how much they would like to will it away. At the same time, the escalating use of these sources of leverage creates greater incentives to promote self-reliance and decoupling. In rare earths, where lead times for mining and refining can prove long and the knowledge and expertise are so concentrated within China, these efforts may take longer than many policymakers around the world, not just in the U.S., would prefer.

London is a reminder that the current status quo will require constant maintenance. Both sides are looking for ways to maintain levers of control. Now that China has exercised greater agency and willingness to use its own economic security tools, the two appear locked in a tug of war – just how stable that arrangement is remains deeply uncertain.

Despite the administration’s insinuations otherwise it is also worth repeating that both Geneva and London only set out the terms of an economic ceasefire; neither contain any components of a long-term deal. The core problems which seem to motivate the Trump administration: China’s persistent trade surplus and the non-market character of much of China’s economy, so far remain entirely unaddressed by the talks. Likewise, one of China’s main concerns, the series of restrictive measures on semiconductors coming out of Washington, despite the scrapping of other export controls, appear to still be off the table. There is a risk that both sides are learning a lesson that is not conducive to a final deal – hold on to any and all sources of leverage in the bilateral relationship. If that is the spirit of a theoretical “grand bargain,” one is left wondering how grand it will really be.

CSIS,"The Architecture of AI Leadership: Enforcement, Innovation, and Global Trust","Published November 6, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/architecture-ai-leadership-enforcement-innovation-and-global-trust,"As global competition in artificial intelligence (AI) intensifies, the United States faces a strategic dilemma: how to protect its most advanced technologies from misuse abroad without undermining the very ecosystem that sustains its leadership. In particular, the diversion of cutting-edge AI chips to China has exposed the limits of traditional export controls. Since the Biden administration placed export controls on advanced semiconductors and related equipment in October 2022, analystsestimatethat over 1 million intentionally downgraded semiconductor chips by the U.S. firm Nvidia have reached China through gray markets. Meanwhile, the massive Chinese technology firm Huawei has allegedlyprocuredmore than 2 million chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)—which makes over90 percentof the world’s advanced semiconductors as of 2023—via front companies, highlighting the scale and sophistication of illicit procurement networks.

In response to this, in May, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced the bipartisan Chip Security Act,mandatingthat high-performance AI chips,classifiedunder Export Control Classification Numbers 3A090 and 4A090, must include “chip security mechanisms” before export. These may include export certificates, periodic location verification via server check-ins, and software-based authentication tools. Exporters would also be required to report any credible evidence of diversion, tampering, or unauthorized use.

Yet while the bill seeks to close post-shipment blind spots, it also raises deeper questions. Can embedded technical controls substitute for institutional enforcement? Will such measures preserve global trust in U.S. technology—or erode it? And most importantly, does this path strengthen or strain the very ecosystem that has kept the United States at the forefront of AI innovation?

The Chip Security Act establishes a two-phase compliance framework: an initial requirement mandating location verification within 180 days, followed by a feasibility assessment of additional security mechanisms—such as anti-tamper features or functionality throttling—led by the Departments of Commerce and Defense. If deemed appropriate, these secondary tools could be mandated within two years. The bill also grants the Secretary of Commerce authority to monitor post-export chip usage, collect data from exporters, and recommend adjustments to export rules based on observed compliance.

Amid mounting industry concerns, proponents of the Chip Security Act have emphasized that the bill’s scope has always been narrowly focused on AI data center-grade graphics processing units (GPUs)—high-performance chips specifically designed for large-scale AI workloads in data centers. Unlike consumer or gaming GPUs, these chips are optimized for tasks such as training and inference of large language models, computer vision, and generative AI. These GPUs typically support massive parallel processing, high memory bandwidth, and specialized AI acceleration features. The draft bill explicitly excludes consumer hardware and edge devices and avoids language suggesting mandatory kill switches, instead prohibiting any feature that could degrade cybersecurity or disable functionality without due process. In theory, new cybersecurity safeguards require the secretary of commerce to ensure mandated mechanisms do not introduce exploitable vulnerabilities. Additionally, the bill defers more invasive enforcement mechanisms, such as performance throttling or telemetry, pending a feasibility study and post-implementation review.

However, the draft leaves several critical issues unresolved. It does not specify how location will be verified if trusted execution environments are compromised, or what enforcement measures will apply if end users spoof telemetry signals. These gaps fuel technical skepticism and political resistance, particularly from stakeholders concerned about implementation feasibility, global trust, and institutional overreach.

More broadly, as the United States tightens controls on advanced AI chips, it must also contend with a shifting perception of U.S. technology and policy in global markets. Policies like the Chip Security Act aim to secure leadership by limiting adversary access, but if not carefully calibrated, they risk eroding the very trust that underpins U.S. dominance in the global semiconductor ecosystem. If implemented prematurely, chip-level controls could inadvertently undercut the administration’s broader goal of promoting U.S. technology as trusted and interoperable abroad. Added power, thermal, or latency burdens mayaffectchip performance, while perceptions of intrusive or unreliable features could weaken confidence in U.S. products. Rather than reinforcing trust, such measures risk creating openings for foreign suppliers to present themselves as more neutral alternatives.

A relevant parallel can be seen in the defense sector, where allies such as Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland have recently walked back or reconsidered purchases of the F-35 fighter jet. Their reasonsincludeconcerns over U.S. control through embedded software, rising costs, and a desire for strategic autonomy, illustrating how overly restrictive terms can push evenclosepartners to seek alternatives.

As efforts to tighten controls escalate, so do the incentives for global actors to diversify away from U.S.-linked supply chains. Therefore, the act may inadvertently create market openings for foreign chipmakers, particularly in Europe and Israel, who may position themselves as geopolitically neutral and free from U.S.-imposed compliance hooks. As concerns grow over embedded telemetry and U.S. oversight, governments and firms in Asia, the Middle East, and even parts of Europe may increasinglyseekalternatives that offer greater supply chain sovereignty.

In this context, companies in countries like France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Israel stand to benefit, not necessarily because of technical superiority, but because their products may be viewed as less politically encumbered. The more U.S. chips are associated with embedded enforcement mechanisms, the more room there may be for international competitors to offer trusted alternatives, intentionally or not.

The controversy surrounding Nvidia’s H20 chip in Chinaoffersan early example of how embedded security features can provoke diplomatic and commercial backlash. In July 2025, the Cyberspace Administration of China summoned Nvidia to addressalleged“backdoor security risks” in its H20 chips, which were custom-designed for the Chinese market. Chinese regulators cited claims, originating from U.S. experts, that the chips could be used to track user locations or be remotely disabled.

The episode came just weeks after the Trump administration reversed an earlier restriction on H20 chip sales to China. Nvidia strongly denied the presence of any backdoors, but the controversy emphasized the diplomatic fragility that accompanies embedded security features, even when framed as compliance tools rather than control mechanisms.

This recent incident echoes a broader historical pattern, where security measures, however well-intentioned, risk triggering international backlash and long-term reputational damage. The Clipper chip episode of the 1990s serves as a historical warning about how security mandates can undermine trust in U.S. technology. The Clipper chip, a National Security Agency–backed initiative toembedencryption keys accessible to the government in consumer devices, triggered global backlash. European and Asian firms beganofferingalternatives to the Clipper chip marketed on privacy and sovereignty grounds, while U.S. tech companies saw reputational damage and commercial losses. The parallels with the Chip Security Act are striking. A well-intentioned national security initiative can erode market confidence and provide competitors with a clear branding advantage: the ability to sell trust.

In this environment, even narrowly targeted measures can generate outsized geopolitical consequences. China hasseizedon these dynamics to advance its domestic AI industry and portray U.S. controls as proof of the need for digital self-reliance. While the Chip Security Act targets only the most advanced data center–grade AI chips, the broader strategic and political effects are likely to extend beyond this scope. Beijing has alreadyusedearlier export controls to justify large-scale investment in domestic firms like Biren and Moore Threads, which now anchor its push for full-stack AI independence. Even limited tracking requirements can and will beportrayedby Beijing as evidence of U.S. overreach, reinforcing China’s drive for indigenous alternatives and digital sovereignty and encouraging nonaligned countries to reconsider the neutrality of U.S. supply chains.

Within this shifting landscape, U.S. chipmakers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), and Intel have remained publicly cautious. While they have not openly opposed the Chip Security Act, they also have not endorsed its provisions. Their posture reflects broader industry sensitivity to proposals that embed compliance mechanisms directly into hardware. The primary concern is not the technical cost of implementation, but rather the strategic risks such features maypose, particularly in markets where sovereignty and supply chain neutrality are prioritized. For globally integrated firms, enforcement hooks that accompany the product risk recasting U.S. chips as tools of extraterritorial regulation rather than neutral infrastructure.

As the geopolitical context of advanced semiconductors intensifies, governments seek new ways to enforce export controls beyond traditional licensing and inspection regimes. Location verification has emerged as a proposed compliance mechanism to bridge the gap between regulatory intent and real-world enforcement capacity. However, the debate over location-based compliance sits at the intersection of strategic technology control, cybersecurity, and supply chain governance.

Proponents of the Chip Security Actarguethat the bill offers a pragmatic solution to persistent enforcement blind spots without imposing intrusive surveillance or remote-control capabilities. They frame the proposed mechanisms, such as export certificates embedded in firmware and periodic Transport Layer Security (TLS)-based location checks, as minimally invasive tools to help the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) detect illicit diversion. TLS-based location verification meansverifyingthat a chip or a system is connecting from an authorized geographic location by embedding geolocation metadata or cryptographic certificates within the TLS handshake process, without exposing sensitive user data. These mechanisms, supporters argue, do notalterchip performance or collect user data but instead generate investigative signals that can flag suspicious behavior. By requiring tamper-resistant verification, the act aims to raise the cost of black-market smuggling, particularly through shell companies and permissive jurisdictions.

Proponents also point to parallels in other sectors, such as enterprise networking and cloud access control, where similar compliance signals support visibility without undermining functionality. They further emphasize that the bill allows for flexible implementation through driver-level authentication or software updates, avoiding the need for invasive firmware changes.

Critics, however, see the act as a fragile technical work-around masquerading as a strategy. In their view, the bill underestimates adversaries’ ability to spoof or circumvent location checks while overestimating the degree of control physical chip tracking provides. Oncedeployedin multi-tenant servers or integrated into broader systems, AI chips become nearly impossible to monitor meaningfully through geolocation alone; a chip in Singapore might serve a U.S. university or a Chinese military contractor, and location tells little about actual use.

Second, theproposedtriangulation methods are highly susceptible to spoofing via VPNs, proxies, or artificial delays, particularly from state actors like China that control network infrastructure.

Third,embeddedtelemetry features also pose cybersecurity risks: “Calling home” opens attack surfaces that could be exploited for surveillance or sabotage. Further, requiring embedded geotracking in high-performance AI chips wouldimposesignificant nonrecurring engineering burdens.

Fourth, the act’s six-month implementation deadline compounds these challenges. Major design and manufacturing changes typically take two to three years to move from concept through validation. Premature mandates could saddle U.S. firms with costly compliance burdens while delivering little real security.

While location verification is framed as a straightforward compliance tool, its practicalfeasibilityis far less certain. Advanced chips themselves lack native connectivity, and many data centers operate behind firewalls, with intermittent or no external internet access, or are intentionally air-gapped for security reasons. Further, hyperscalers also rarely run all purchased chipssimultaneously, meaning that the absence of a signal cannot be reliably equated with diversion or tampering. Hyperscalers are technology companies that operate vast, globally distributed data centers capable of rapidly expanding computing, storage, and networking capacity to meet demand. By designing their own hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, they deliver large-scale digital services and power emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Leading examples include Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, whose hyperscale operations underpin much of today’s cloud and AI ecosystem.

Moreover, the “trusted server network” provisioned by the Chip Security Act does not yet exist, and building such a global infrastructure would require significant international coordination and investment. Without these prerequisites, the proposal rests on assumptions of universal connectivity that do not reflect operational realities, making enforcement inconsistent at best and misleading at worst.

Designing a leading-edge AI GPU already costsupwardsof $500 million at the 5-nanometer (nm) node, with projections exceeding $700 million for 3 nm and below. The 5 nm and 3 nm nodesreferto advanced semiconductor manufacturing generations that indicate how small and densely packed a chip’s transistors are, with smaller nodes enabling higher performance and efficiency but at much greater design and production cost. Toimplementlocation verification at scale, companies like Nvidia would need two components: a firmware update enabling rapid location checks (estimated at under $1 million) and a global network of 100–500 trusted landmark servers, costing $2.5–12.5 million annually.

Beyond technical costs, firms would face ongoing management overhead, including export-specific compliance processes, audits, incident response playbooks, and coordination across legal, engineering, and sales teams. For globally integrated companies, these burdens compound operational complexity without offering clear commercial upside. More strategically, critics warn that embedding traceability features mayerodetrust in U.S. chips, prompting customers in key markets to shift toward non-U.S. suppliers viewed as more neutral or less vulnerable to embedded controls.

The Chip Security Act assumes that denying China access to advanced U.S. chips will significantly slow its frontier AI progress. Yet China’s ecosystem—illustrated by the rise of labs like DeepSeek—shows that controls can delay but not decisively block development. DeepSeek hasbuiltcompetitive large language models using a mix of pre-ban chips, sanctioned imports, and smuggled hardware, highlighting persistent enforcement gaps. These flows, worth billions of dollars, havebluntedthe impact of 2022–2023 export controls. Addressing this challenge requires more than technical fixes; it demandsstrongerinstitutional capacity at BIS, which today lacks the scale, tools, and reach to monitor chips across complex global supply chains.

Hardware mandates cannot replace intelligence-drivenenforcement. Strengthening U.S. capacity to track GPU end-use, expand counterproliferation tools, and share information with allies is essential to disrupt diversion networks. Smart monitoring of end-use patterns will deliver more durable security than embedding technical fixes into hardware.

While the Chip Security Act attempts to close this gap by embedding location verification features into hardware—an approach that shifts part of the enforcement burden to the chip itself—technical signals alone cannot substitute for strategic enforcement infrastructure. Sustaining U.S. advantage in a contested AI landscape will require not just smarter chips, but smarter institutions empowered to monitor, investigate, and disrupt illicit flows in real time.

As BIS leadership hasemphasizedin recent testimony, there is a need for enhancing legal authority, investigative capacity, and international coordination to bolster export control mechanisms. Strengthening these pillars would allow BIS to detect and disrupt illicit supply chains through targeted investigations, interagency intelligence sharing, and bilateral enforcement partnerships more effectively. Increased funding would support the expansion of BIS’s Export Enforcement and Office of Technology Evaluation, investment in advanced supply chain analytics, and more rigorous end-use checks overseas.

Additional investigative personnel, including attachés embedded with foreign governments, would improve monitoring of third-country transshipment routes and shell company networks. Stronger international coordination, through data-sharing agreements and jointinvestigationswith customs and export control authorities in key diversion hubs such as the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, would help close critical enforcement gaps that no embedded hardware feature can address.

To sustain leadership in AI and semiconductors, the United States must focus on a broader capability-driven strategy thatadvancesthe goals outlined in the administration’s AI Action Plan: expanding global AI alliances, countering adversary influence, and securing the AI technology stack through coordinated governance and enforcement.

To uphold theeffectivenessof export controls in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, the United States must expand the institutional capacity of the BIS. BIS is tasked with enforcing export laws, yet it remains under-resourced relative to the scale of the challenge. Strengthening enforcement requires expanding staffing, deploying attachés to key transshipment hubs, and investing in advanced supply chain analytics to track chip diversion and end-use patterns in high-risk jurisdictions. These capabilities areessentialfor identifying illicit flows, closing enforcement gaps, and reinforcing the credibility of U.S. technology controls.

Before mandating chip-level controls, the U.S. should ensure technical feasibility through an independent review led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As the government’s standards body, NIST is best placed to validate solutions with industry and allies, reducing fragmentation and ensuring that any requirements are practical, secure, and widely trusted. A NIST-led process would also help separate credible, scalable technologies from unproven startup claims, grounding policy in independent science rather than vendor assurances. Anchoring technical standards in a transparent and collaborative framework is essential for the United States to strengthen both the security and legitimacy of its export control system.

Rather than relying solely on restrictive mandates, the United States shouldencouragevoluntary end-user verification mechanisms that reward transparency and responsible behavior. This approach allows trusted firms to access U.S. technology under streamlined conditions, while reserving punitive measures for persistent noncompliance. Hence, by working with allies and partners to implement aligned standards, the U.S. can build a trusted AI export ecosystem that counters adversarial misuse without burdening legitimate innovation. This framework supports both commercial competitiveness and national security by fostering a network of reliable and accountable AI actors.

As AI development increasingly shifts from local infrastructure to scalable, on-demand cloud platforms, U.S. export controls must evolve accordingly. Today, adversaries no longer need toimportphysical chips; they can simply rent high-performance compute from U.S. cloud providers to train frontier models. This loophole undermines the intent of export restrictions and exposes U.S.-origin technology to strategic misuse. Without clear rules for cloud computing, efforts to constrain the diffusion of dual-use AI capabilities risk becoming obsolete.

The goal of cloud restrictions is not to monitor, but to ensure accountability in how advanced compute is used. Just as banks are required to verify their customers to prevent illicit finance, cloud service providers should be required to verify and monitor high-risk AI workloads. Proposals such as the ENFORCE Act and H.R. 4683markimportant steps toward building an oversight architecture that matches the realities of modern compute delivery. These frameworks would enable regulators to detect and disrupt malicious actors without placing undue burden on trusted users.

Done right, cloud restrictions can enhance, not inhibit, U.S. competitiveness. By establishing standards for responsible AI use in the cloud, the U.S. can build a coalition of trusted providers and democratic partners who agree on baseline safeguards.

Finally, control alone is not sufficient to build lasting technological leadership; it must be matched by proactive investment in the capabilities that drive long-term advantage. Hence, to maintain leadership in AI, the United States mustinvestin the foundations of technological strength—world-class talent and universities—and fully support cutting-edge research. Export controls may impose short-term constraints on adversaries, but they cannot substitute sustained investments in innovation at competitive levels. This requires expanding funding for foundational and applied AI research, fostering public-private research and development collaboration, and building career pathways to develop and retain top technical talent in critical sectors. Just as vital is strengthening supply chain partnerships to ensure that U.S. technology remains a trusted, high-quality choice for allies and partners around the world.

The Chip Security Act seeks to address real vulnerabilities in the current export control system, but embedding compliance into hardware is not a substitute for strategic enforcement. Many of the act’s proposed technical mechanisms still require clarification—on feasibility, interoperability, and security—to ensure they do not introduce new risks or hinder competitiveness. As AI development moves to the cloud and global competition intensifies, U.S. leadership will hinge less on restrictive mechanisms and more on continued innovation backed by resilient institutions, credible governance, and trusted supply chains.

To stay ahead, the United States must modernize its enforcement architecture, bolster BIS capacity, extend oversight to virtual compute, and coordinate with allies to align standards. Export controls should enable innovation, not constrain it, and above all, not erode confidence and acceptance of U.S. high-tech manufacturing equipment and products. By investing in capability, not just control, the United States can preserve its edge in AI infrastructure while upholding the trust that sustains its global leadership.

Export Controls: More Harm Than Good? | Marco Macchiavelli

Why Giving Up on Export Controls Is Giving Up on the Tech Race | Navin Girishankar and Matthew S. Borman

Marco Macchiavelli, Assistant Professor of Finance, University of Massachusetts Amherst

In the midst of the current technological rivalry between the United States and China, the U.S. government hasemployedexport controls torestrictChina from acquiring advanced domestic technology. In particular, the Department of Commerce has the power to forbid domestic firms from exporting certain technologies to a list of Chinese entities, such as Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The purpose of U.S. export controls is to safeguard the technological competitive edge of the U.S. economy and to limit the transfer of dual-use technologies to China and its military.

However, by their very nature, export controls harm the profitability of domestic firms producing the very same technologies that export controls are trying to safeguard. Indeed, as documented inCrosignani et al. (2024), once their Chinese customers are subject to export controls, domestic firms experience a decline in revenues, profitability, and stock market capitalization. The decline in revenues comes from the fact that these domestic firms cannot easily find alternative non-Chinese customers to make up for the loss in revenues caused by export controls. If the U.S. government is keen to continue using export controls, it seems natural to ask whether it should incentivize the reshoring of critical high-value-added segments of the supply chain to the United States. The main concern is that incentives given to inefficient national champions, such as Intel, may ultimately waste taxpayer money and add production capacity to firms that are far behind the cutting edge, ultimately worsening the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.

To holistically assess the effectiveness of export controls, we still need a few questions answered.

First, the issue of circumvention. A few non-U.S. firms build machinery that is instrumental for the production of advanced technologies. See, for instance, the case of ASML, the most advanced producer of lithographic tools that are necessary for advanced microchips. ASML was selling its machines to China until the U.S. government successfullylobbiedthe Dutch government to stop it. Circumvention takes place in other ways too, including setting up front companies that purchase the restricted technologies under a false identity, only to reexport them to the very same Chinese firms subject to export controls. Notice that reexport is a violation of export controls, but it is challenging to enforce. Recentreportsindeed suggest that some AI chips subject to export controls were smuggled to China.

Second, as with any intervention, we need to consider the so-called blowback, namely the counteracting force that may ultimately blunt the usefulness of export controls. Are export controls forcing China to decouple from the United States even faster, and to double down on indigenous innovation to substitute the U.S. technologies under export controls? Are export controls intensifying intellectual property (IP) theft by China? There is little to no empirical evidence to assess the magnitude of these channels, and more research is needed. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that China is getting closer to the cutting edge in advanced technologies. After an almost complete collapse as the first export controls were introduced in 2019, Huawei shocked markets in 2023 when it unveiled a new phone containing advanced chips. Similarly, DeepSeekrattledthe AI sector when it displayedcompetitiveoutcomes at a fraction of the computational cost.

And finally, the most important question. What is the goal here? China has become very efficient at scaling manufacturing in record times, something that no other country seems to be able to do at that same level of efficiency. As such, China has become a key partner to U.S. businesses, including Apple. The main justification for U.S. countermeasures is the persistent and pervasive use of espionage tactics to conduct IP theft from U.S. companies, government labs, and universities. The goal of an economic strategy toward China should be to maintain economic synergies while preserving domestic IP protection. Moreover, if the United States wants to maintain leverage on China, export controls are clearly a self-inflicted wound as they reduce domestic leverage and instead boost Chinese independence from the U.S. economic orbit.

Navin Girishankar, President, Economic Security and Technology Department, and Matt Borman, Senior Technical Expert (Non-resident), Economic Security and Technology Department

Any serious debate about export controls—a tool to protect U.S. and allied national security in today’s tech race—must start with a blunt fact: the United States now faces a wider set of threats from adversaries, chiefly the People’s Republic of China (PRC), than it did from the Soviet Union. There are national security threats, including Beijing’s declared policy of civil-military fusion, designed to rapidly channel commercial breakthroughs into military capabilities aimed at the United States and its allies. There are collateral threats to U.S. technology leadership: China is an innovation competitor with a surging research base, its firms are battle-tested in global competition, and its ecosystems are poised to lock in advantage across life sciences, robotics, climate tech, and potentially quantum communications. And there are economic security threats: China is not only embedded in global technology markets but also able and practiced in using malign and mercantile tactics—IP theft, coercive partnerships, state-subsidized dumping—to acquire advanced technologies, build capacity, and seize market share.

Most critics of export controls, underplay—or like Marco Macchiavelli—simply do not acknowledge the threats to U.S. and allied national security that undermine the integrity of technology markets, the security of the United States’ assets (including intangible assets such as ideas), and the long-term incentives for U.S. companies to grow and compete. He correctly notes—but overweights—the concern that export controls cut off U.S. companies from China’s large, competitive, and increasingly innovative market. Let’s take his case point by point.

Profitability.Macchiavelli claims export controls hurt U.S. companies’ profitability. True—they impose costs and lost sales. But the relevant measure is the relative competitive position of firms. Effective controls mean blocking access from both U.S. and non-U.S. sources to prevent erosion of market share to foreign competitors. The real risk is not missing a sale to Huawei—it is allowing foreign competitor firms to undercut U.S. controls, allowing China to reach the frontier faster, develop substitutes, and then reenter global markets, including ours, on terms that displace American products. That scenario is far more damaging to long-term U.S. technological leadership and U.S. national security that comes from technology leadership, than the immediate loss of export revenue. This is precisely why export controls must be coordinated with allies to close off alternative supply routes.

Circumvention.Macchiavelli is correct to point out that front companies and gray markets exist. But leaping from implementation challenges to discounting the very use of export controls is overkill. Without export controls, PRC-linked firms would not need to circumvent anything—access to advanced, dual-use capabilities would be wide open. The real test is whether controls raise costs, slow timelines, and create friction. Evidence says they do: PRC AI developers are payingdouble market pricesfor smuggled, leading-edge chips, moving them through complex third-country transshipments. That is not seamless access—that is delay and disruption. Even with massive annual government subsidies, China’s indigenous chip production capabilities continue to lag behind leading-edge capabilities. And when key allies in Europe and Asia limit key exports, the effect compounds: local enforcement plus U.S. coordination yields better compliance and stronger impact.

Design-Out.Macchiavelli’s “design-out” argument—that controls spur China to innovate around them—is valid.Some of our CSIS scholarshave pointed out this risk, but it ignores the counterfactual. Beijing’s self-sufficiency drive predates the current export control policy. Indeed, it is a central plank of Chinese industrial strategy, enshrined in initiatives like “Made in China 2025” and the 14th Five-Year Plan’s push for “technology independence.” Again, the relevant question is whether the PRC’s advances would be faster or slower without controls. The evidence suggests that export controls have bought time—giving the United States a “commanding lead” in key dimensions of the AI competition, and through allied cooperation, ensuring that China’sdomestically produced semiconductor equipment toolsand chips remain behind, despite massive state investment. Granted, buying time is valuable only if the United States uses it to invest and innovate—a question that deserves more attention and scrutiny.

A Tool, Not a Strategy.Export controls are a tool, not a strategy. To be effective, they should be deployed in service of clear goals and complemented by other economic tools. Here, we agree with Macchiavelli, although he appears skeptical of any form of industrial policy, including the use of national champions. That’s a worthwhile debate—what is the right mix of tools to securitize U.S. innovation? Is combining export controls with subsidized national champions more or less effective than using export controls along with domestic deregulation and investment attraction policies?

Beyond China.Macchiavelli misses that export controls, as an instrument of U.S. national security policy, matter far beyond the China context. Since 2022, they have eroded Russia’s ability to produce precision missiles by increasing costs and forcing reliance on inferior substitutes. These benefits should be acknowledged, even while noting Russia’s ability to acquire chips from the PRC and other sources. The larger point is that, in an age of multipolar technology risks, the United States requires export controls for more than one adversary.

Like any other economic tool, export controls are not perfect. They must continue to evolve to address modern threats related to the AI diffusion, quantum computing, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. Discounting them based on a lopsided understanding of their role in economic and national security would be to accept a faster erosion of the very technological edge that underwrites U.S. security.

Going forward, the efficacy of export controls will depend on setting clear goals, as Macchiavelli correctly points out—but it will also depend on targeting technologies where the returns to national security are greatest, establishing metrics to evaluate impact, monitoring their impact in near-real time, and coordinating with allies. It will also require adequate resourcing for the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security to expand technological expertise, enforcement capacity, and engagement with allies.

Such efforts, however, will be diminished if export controls are used as bargaining chips in trade talks. For this reason, the Trump administration’s recent reversal on restrictions on chips in response to China’s easing of its rare earth restrictions, as well asreportsthat licenses are being provided to U.S. companies in exchange for a share of export revenues, is worrying. Such moves suggest that this vital tool in America’s economic security arsenal is transactional rather than principled, negotiable rather than inviolable.

CSIS,Beyond Rare Earths: China’s Growing Threat to Gallium Supply Chains,"Published July 17, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/beyond-rare-earths-chinas-growing-threat-gallium-supply-chains,"China is increasingly weaponizing its chokehold over critical minerals amid intensifying economic and technological competition with the United States. The critical mineral gallium, which is crucial to defense industry supply chains and new energy technologies, has been at the front line of China’s strategy. To date, China’s chokehold on rare earth metals has attracted more attention than its restrictions on gallium, and some have downplayed the potential consequences of disruptions to gallium supply chains. Yet CSIS analysis reveals the extent to which China can wield gallium to impose significant economic harm on the United States and its allies and partners. This CSIS Brief unpacks the scope of the problem and offers policy recommendations on how to bolster U.S. and allied economic security and deny China a key tool of economic warfare.

Amid spiraling trade tensions with the United States, Beijing has brandished anew arsenalof economic weapons, with few proving more potent than its export controls on critical minerals. As of May 2025, China hadrestrictedthe export of at least 16 key minerals and alloys, many of which are essential inputs for products ranging from consumer electronics to F-35 fighter jets. These measures have struck deep into U.S. and allied supply chains, and appear to have given China substantial leverage in its ongoing trade and technology negotiations with the United States.

As the impacts of these controls hit global markets, examining the case of gallium—a little-known but crucial metal—offers a powerful warning signal. China has a near-total monopoly over gallium production, accounting for a startling 98 percent of the world’s primary supply. The mineral was among the first to be caught in the escalating tit-for-tat trade restrictions between the United States and China, making headlines when itlandedon Beijing’s export control list (alongside germanium) in July 2023.

That initial broadside was largely awarning shotdesigned to showcase Beijing’s capacity to impose pain on sensitive U.S. supply chains while limiting broader impacts on the global economy. Now, China is tightening the screws.

New research by CSIS, supported by data provided by minerals supply chain intelligence companyRovjok, reveals that China’s gallium restrictions are having a greater impact than previously anticipated. This is due to both tighter enforcement against transshipment and new controls on specialized gallium extraction technologies that are not available outside China.

This brief presents several key findings:

Responding to this mounting crisis will require the United States to take urgent steps to develop alternative sources of gallium supply and extraction technologies. Fortunately, the financial investments needed are relatively modest and promising solutions are well within reach—but only with a level of sustained policy attention that has only just begun to materialize.

China’s use of critical mineral export controls is not a new phenomenon, but it has evolved in recent years from a policy bludgeon to a precision tool. A defining early example came in 2011, when Beijing temporarilywithheldrare earth exports to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. China backed off from those restrictions within months, but not before sending rare earth prices skyrocketing over 80 percent and leaving Japanese officials scrambling for alternatives.

In 2019, China trained this threat against the United States. As trade frictions flared under the first Trump administration, Chinese leader Xi Jinping publiclyvisiteda rare earth processing facility in a conspicuous warning about the potential costs of further escalation.

Over the ensuing years, China further strengthened its hand by developing a legal and regulatory framework to transform these scattered actions into a comprehensive export control system. In 2020, the Chinese legislaturepassedthe Export Control Law, which gave Beijing streamlined authorities to exercise “control on the export of dual-use items.” Unprecedented in Chinese export control regimes, the law included a provision claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction, meaning even entities outside of China could be held accountable for violating its statutes.

In July 2023, China put these tools to the test,announcingnew licensing requirements limiting the export of gallium and germanium. The rules were broadly seen as retaliation against a series of landmark export controls put in place between October 2022 and July 2023 by theUnited States,Japan, andthe Netherlandsbanning the sale of leading-edge chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

China’s initial restrictions were cautious but calculated. Stopping short of an outright ban, they required gallium and germanium exporters to apply for licenses and disclose detailed end-use tracing information about their clients to China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). Notably, MOFCOMemphasizedthat these measures did “not target any specific country.” Still, the move sent a powerful signal that if China’s semiconductor industry were denied Western chips and tools, China could deny the West crucial raw materials and intermediate inputs.

Beijing significantly tightened these restrictions as U.S. technology controls ramped up. In December 2024, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Securityannounceda package of expanded chip-related controls, including the addition of 140 Chinese semiconductor firms onto its Entity List. Just one day later, MOFCOMissuedan update to its own export controls which functionally banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States.

The order marked the most stringent export controls China has put in place. For the first time, the ruling asserted the long-arm jurisdiction that China built into its Export Control Law years earlier,declaringthat “any organization or individual of any country or region” would be held responsible for violating it. In effect, the rule formally outlawed the re-export or transshipment of gallium and other covered materials to the United States through third countries or territories, closing a major enforcement loophole.

Less than one month later, Beijing took its gallium export controls even further in a quiet but consequential move. On January 2, 2025, MOFCOMamendedits export control catalogue to include several of the key extraction technologies used to separate gallium metal from its host ores (generally bauxite or zinc). The addition indicates that China is now taking steps to preserve its leverage over gallium supply chains by withholding the most cost-efficient means of extracting it.

In May 2025, China escalated once again bylaunchinga coordinated interagency push to crack down on the smuggling and transshipment of restricted critical minerals. Coinciding with high-level U.S.-China trade discussions in Geneva, China’s State Export Control Work Coordination Mechanism Office convened over 10 central ministries—including MOFCOM and the Ministry of State Security (MSS)—as well as dozens of local officials to deepen enforcement over strategic mineral exports. China’s MSS has previouslypublicizedits efforts to foil gallium smuggling attempts, but the new mechanism reflects Beijing’s deepened commitment to reinforcing its emerging export control system.

The creeping expansion of China’s gallium restrictions, from limited licensing requirements and end-user controls to full on embargos and long-arm export bans, offers important clues as to how the ongoing trade war may escalate. Beijing has already shown that it can use the progression of its gallium export controls as a playbook for choking off the United States and its partners from a broader range of strategic minerals.

Initial reactions in the United States to China’s gallium export restrictions downplayed the potential for disruption. In the months following China’s first 2023 announcement of its controls, company representatives, policy analysts, and government officials expressed confidence that production lines would remain unaffected and that alternative sources would quickly come online.

Leading chipmakers and downstream manufacturersreassuredreporters and investors that their supplies were diversified, assessing that there would be “no material impact.” Citing international customs and trade data,analystspointedto the low amount of gallium products imported directly from China to the United States to suggest that dependencies were negligible. Even U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan appeared unconcerned,remarkingat a CSIS event in late 2024 that “there are other sources of . . . gallium in the world.”

Yet, these optimistic assessments obscured deeper structural vulnerabilities that have grown increasingly acute as China’s gallium controls have tightened. This analysis highlights three key developments which suggest that the risk of China’s gallium restrictions to U.S. and allied supply chains is greater than previously understood.

Since China’s export controls went into effect in August 2023, the price of gallium has diverged sharply between domestic Chinese and international markets. Within a month of the initial announcement, low-purity gallium prices in the Rotterdam exchangespikedby over 43 percent as Chinese suppliers halted shipments while applying for export licenses from MOFCOM.

This surge can be partially explained by a widespread rush by international buyers to stockpile gallium before the controls took effect. However, prices did not come back down even after demand stabilized, reflecting the impact of a supply-side squeeze caused by reduced Chinese exports of gallium.

The cost of gallium outside of China, represented by its listed price on the Rotterdam exchange, has continued to significantly diverge from domestic price points as Chinese exports have fallen. By early 2024, prices appeared to have largely decoupled into two distinct markets, with gallium sold outside of China at nearly double the price of that within China (see Figure 2). Chinese customs data helps tell the story, showing that the country’s average monthly gallium exports drop significantly after August 2023 (see Figure 3).

These trends have intensified following China’s escalation of its controls to a full-scale embargo on the U.S. market beginning in December 2024. Tighter due diligence requirements, imposed by the extraterritoriality clause in the new controls, have further reduced China’s gallium exports and caused prices to surge to record highs. By mid-December, gallium prices jumped to their highest level since 2011 and continued to climb precipitously. In May 2025, the Rotterdam price of gallium reached $687 per kg, an increase of over 150 percent over pre-control prices.

Meanwhile, gallium prices within China have fallen due a combination of domestic oversupply and a lower demand outlook triggered by a recentshiftin China’s photovoltaics industry away from technologies requiring gallium. The fact that this excess supply is not being exported, despite sky-high prices in overseas markets, reflects the seriousness of Beijing’s most recent controls.

Compelling anecdotal evidence provided by firms similarly points to a major supply crunch impacting not only U.S. companies but also major firms in allied countries like Japan and South Korea. Japanese officials and executives have expressedconcernover the impacts of China’s newly escalated licensing requirements on gallium exports, equating the rules to “some sort of declaration of economic war against the rest of the world.” South Korean sources have similarly reported to the authors that Korean firms have been forced to wait months for licenses from MOFCOM, with some being denied.

These developments confirm analysts’ worst fears about China’s ability and willingness to meaningfully constrain global access to gallium. While the full extent of the impact of these measures on sensitive production lines remains unclear, companies downstream of the gallium supply chain could soon face dire challenges. The case of Henkel, a German producer of industrial adhesives that was recently forced todeclareforce majeure on its deliveries due to disruptions from China’s restrictions of antimony, stands as a dire warning.

China’s decision to target gallium was driven by unique market dynamics that provide Beijing with an unusual degree of leverage over the mineral’s global supply. In 2024, China produced 98 percent of the world’s low-purity gallium, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS)—a figure well above its share of production of other targeted minerals such as germanium (68 percent) and antimony (48 percent). As a result of this near total monopoly, China can credibly withhold access to gallium supply from downstream markets, leaving buyers with few short-term alternatives.

The relatively small quantity of gallium consumed globally each year similarly provides China with acute leverage over markets. Annual demand for gallium is below 700 metric tons (t) internationally, a fraction of the massive markets for minerals like copper (25.9 million t) or nickel (3.1 million t). While demand for gallium is rising quickly, its comparatively small market means that even limited supply variations can have significant impacts on its global availability. This also makes gallium prices highly sensitive to minor supply adjustments, giving Beijing considerable leverage to manipulate market forces by artificially releasing or withholding flows.

China’s stranglehold over gallium supply chains is rooted in its leading position in aluminum production. Gallium is not extracted directly from the earth—instead, it is recovered as a byproduct of processing other materials, primarily bauxite (the mother ore of aluminum), with a small amount also from zinc.

As China emerged as the world’s dominant producer of aluminum over the past two decades, it also developed the scale and technical capabilities to mass-produce gallium. Leading state-owned aluminum processors like the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chalco) wereencouragedby state authorities to install the equipment needed to extract gallium from aluminum tailings. As China’s production of low-purity gallium began to explode and flood global markets around 2010, severe price fluctuations forced most of the leading non-Chinese suppliers out of the business over the following decade (see Figure 5a and 5b).

Left as virtually the only supplier in the world, China found itself with the means to translate its market dominance over gallium into geopolitical leverage in a way that few in the West saw coming.

Even firms not directly reliant on low-purity gallium could soon begin to feel the impacts of China’s restrictions. China’s direct dominance over gallium recedes further down the supply chain, diminishing to around 50 percent in the production of refined (high-purity) gallium and even less for intermediate products like gallium compounds and semiconductor wafers. Yet, these downstream inputs remain almost entirely dependent on gallium feedstock originating in China.

The relatively scant publicly available data on gallium flows has contributed to an illusion of supply chain resilience among some U.S. firms and analysts. The United States has never imported a majority of its low-purity gallium from China, creating the appearance of a diversified supply. Even after U.S. imports of Chinese gallium zeroed out following China’s 2023 export controls, the United States was still able to source imports from countries like Japan, Germany, and other partners, suggesting that it could easily route around Chinese controls. For high-purity gallium, the United States even has onedomestically basedsupplier in operation, reducing its reliance on imports.

However, China’s new export controls should complicate this sense of security. MOFCOM’s licensing system now requires importers of Chinese gallium to provide detailed end-user tracing information, and foreign firms that supply U.S. companies with gallium at any point in the supply chain risk losing access to their only viable source of raw gallium if discovered. This creates strong incentives for foreign firms to halt service to their U.S. customers, as the marginal U.S. market for gallium likely does not justify the risks involved. These dynamics are further heightened by uncertainty over the extent of China’s enforcement.

China’s expanded controls could also begin to impact the few existing alternatives to Chinese gallium feedstock, which are primarily recycling facilities that recover gallium from scrap generated via the downstream wafer substrate manufacturing process. As an example, Japan uses approximately 40 percent of domestically recovered scrap and 60 percent primary low-purity gallium from China as feedstock into its domestic refining production. Still, the production capacity at its recycling facilities is limited and relatively costly, and ultimately it remains reliant on drawdowns from existing inventories that could gradually shrink as China further withholds upstream supply.

These challenges are reflected in a detailed 2024studyby the U.S. Geological Survey—published prior to China’s updated export controls—which estimates that a full-scale Chinese embargo of gallium could cause an $8 billion hit to U.S. gross domestic product. The largest projected losses were concentrated in the semiconductor industry, underscoring the vulnerability of strategic U.S. supply chains to China’s controls.

China’s dominant position over gallium supply chains extends beyond the raw material itself. A more opaque but similarly consequential constraint lies in the specialized resin technology used to extract gallium from bauxite ore processing.

As previously mentioned, China’s dominance over gallium production is not the result of a monopoly over access to deposits—gallium is fairly abundant—but rather its unmatched ability to extract the metal at scale and at lower cost. Chinese state-backed companies have outpaced global competitors by investing in the energy-intensive, chemically complex, and environmentally taxing process of extracting gallium from the Bayer liquor created during the processing of bauxite ore.

One of the most expensive steps in this process is isolating gallium from ore tailings at volumes that make production commercially viable. Chinese firms have innovated new methods of doing this at lowered costs. In particular, the chemical company Sunresin has developed a proprietary chelating resin tailored for gallium recovery. This resin outperforms older methods in both adsorption capacity and operational lifespan, allowing producers to extract more gallium per cycle with less material degradation.

As a result of China’s dominant domestic gallium industry, Chinese firms can produce these resins with economies of scale that their overseas competitors cannot match. Chinese facilities can thus produce gallium more cheaply and further extend their dominance, creating a positive feedback loop. This high-performance resin is critical to keeping China’s production costs well below what Western producers can match.

The challenge is compounded by the fact that this resin is neither widely manufactured outside of China nor readily substitutable. Sunresin produces as much as 90 percent of the global supply. While other methods of extracting gallium exist, they are more expensive and degrade more quickly, making it difficult for non-Chinese producers to compete with China on price, even under normal market conditions.

Recognizing the strategic value of this technology, Chinese authorities in 2025 quietly expanded their export controls to include the resin itself. A Januaryupdateadded “technologies for extracting gallium metal from alumina mother liquor using ion-exchange or resin methods” (通过离子交换法、树脂法等方法从氧化铝母液中提取金属镓的技术和工艺) to MOFCOM’s export control list. Industry sources have reported that exports of the high-performance resin have ceased entirely due to these new restrictions.

For the United States and its allies, this presents a fundamental obstacle to rebuilding domestic gallium supply chains. Even with feedstock and refining infrastructure in place, producers outside of China are unlikely to achieve competitive costs without equivalent resin performance. Until incentives are put in place to support the production of high-performance resin at adequate scale, non-Chinese producers will struggle to compete.

Gallium is used within a wide range of technologies, from advanced semiconductors to light emitting diodes, laser diodes, and permanent magnets. Yet, gallium’s true importance to the United States is not reflected properly in official reporting. The USGS shows gallium consumption in the United States to be around 20 t per year. However, taking into account imports of gallium-based wafers, magnets, and LEDs, consumption is likely far higher, up to 200 t per year (see Figure 8).

Critically, gallium’s outsized importance to key defense supply chains has elevated its value as a source of strategic leverage for China. China’s decision to open its controls with gallium—rather than other more commercially important minerals—allowed it to signal its capacity to disrupt U.S. and allied defense production while avoiding broader damage to its own economy.

The importance of gallium to advanced defense systems is difficult to overstate. Gallium compounds enable a class of “wide bandgap” semiconductors that outperform silicon in extreme operating conditions. Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors, for example, can operate at higher voltages and temperatures with lower losses, making them ideal for advanced radar, electronic warfare systems, and other applications requiring efficient power conversion.

U.S. defense systems have incorporated gallium-based technology for decades, but gallium compounds have taken on an increasingly critical role. Recent improvements in GaN chip design and falling fabrication costs have brought about rapid advances in next-generation radar technology. Widespread adoption of GaN chips has enabled smaller radar modules to track targets with higher resolution at farther distances. GaN-backed modules have been integrated into the U.S. military’s most important modern radar systems, including the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 radar, the Marine Corps’ G/ATOR radar, the Army’s LTAMDS radar, the Missile Defense Agency’s AN/TPY-2 radar, and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter’s upgraded AESA radar, to name just a few.

Gallium-enabled radar systems will also play an irreplaceable role in any efforts to build a layered nationwide missile defense shield, like the “Golden Dome” proposed by President Donald Trump. For example, Lockheed’s GaN-basedLong Range Discrimination Radar—which is currentlyundergoingfield testing in Alaska and will likely go into service next year—would form a crucial layer in the system’s defense against ballistic missile attacks.

Meanwhile, the Department of Defense hasinvestedmillions of dollars in recent years to develop another emerging compound, called gallium oxide. Gallium oxide has an even wider bandgap and better performance potential than GaN, and it could form the backbone of a new generation of even more powerful and efficient defense electronic systems.

These and other technical developments have made U.S. and allied defense systems deeply reliant on technologies made with gallium. Open-source assessmentsrevealthat over 11,000 individual parts used across the U.S. Department of Defense require gallium, and nearly 85 percent of defense supply chains containing gallium are known to include at least one Chinese supplier.

Key U.S. allies and security partners, ranging from Poland to Saudi Arabia to Taiwan, have also placed orders for U.S.-built GaN-enabled radar systems in recent years. As a result, supply vulnerabilities extend beyond the United States to its most important strategic partners.

The extent to which China can derive leverage from its monopoly over gallium production fundamentally depends on how fast alternative supply sources can come online. If plants outside of China can rapidly begin or restart gallium extraction, then China’s ability to threaten global supply chains will quickly diminish. While promising initiatives are underway to establish new gallium production capabilities, decisive government action is needed to ensure these efforts are protected from China’s market manipulation.

On its face, the gallium problem appears to have a clear market solution. As China restricts global supply, the rising global price of gallium should entice new producers into the market, creating alternatives to Chinese supply. The more China uses its leverage, the less it should have left.

However, the unique market characteristics of gallium discussed in the previous section mean that this challenge is unlikely to be solved by market forces alone. With near-complete control over the floodgates of global supply, Beijing can easily manipulate gallium prices to desired levels. In practice, this means that firms seeking to enter the market cannot guarantee that the market price of gallium will remain high enough to cover production costs. If alternative suppliers appear to be ramping up production, China could suddenly flood the market, cratering prices and erasing profits.

Gallium’s small market size relative to the huge aluminum market further adds to the challenge. For a Western alumina refinery, adding a gallium side-stream would impart additional complexity and risk for only a tiny fraction of the revenue generated by its alumina production.

China’s exclusive access to the most advanced resins used to extract gallium also gives its domestic refineries a significant cost advantage, further reducing incentives for foreign firms to compete. Absent market conditions that can support the scaled production of gallium extraction resins outside of China, non-Chinese firms will likely remain at a prohibitively large cost disadvantage in primary gallium production compared with their Chinese competitors.

These factors reflect the limits of relying on market forces to respond to China’s export controls. While current market conditions (characterized by rising demand, highly constrained supply, and high prices) have spurred considerable interest from new gallium producers worldwide, a long-term solution will require sustained government action if it is to incentivize firms to enter the market and stay there.

Given these market limitations, government intervention will be necessary to ensure that short-term, long-term, and emergency requirements for gallium material can be readily met. Some U.S. government agencies have taken initial steps toward finding alternative suppliers, yet more work is needed to move beyond assessments toward concrete action. This includes taking swift action to support promising efforts by private companies.

Federal investments to expand domestic gallium production have begun to take shape. In 2024, the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI Hub) announced up to $10 million in federal funding to accelerate early-stage R&D for critical mineral extraction technologies, including gallium. This funding aims to unlock more efficient methods for gallium byproduct recovery, separation, and concentration—areas where the United States has lagged behind China’s resin-based extraction processes. The Department of Defense (DOD) has similarly begun using its Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities toprioritizeawards for gallium recovery projects.

While these are positive first steps toward meeting long-term needs, more action is required to address the immediate and short-term vulnerabilities caused by China’s tightening restrictions. For example, while the DOD maintains a National Defense Stockpile (NDS) of critical materials, thisdoes notinclude gallium. Even in the wake of China’s export controls, the Defense Logistics Agency—which manages the NDS—left gallium off its materials procurementplanfor 2025. While the NDS haslimitations, the idea of including a minimum stockpile of gallium is a low-cost insurance policy against the worst-case outcomes of China’s restrictions.

More federal support can also accelerate promising efforts that are already underway to find viable domestic supply alternatives. The Idaho National Laboratory is leading the development of integrated separation and processing systems for rare earth–rich ore bodies, such as those at the Sheep Creek deposit in Montana. Notably, recent geological assessments at Sheep Creek suggest the site contains the highest concentrations of gallium found in any known U.S. deposit. Private sector partners such as the U.S. Critical Materials Corporation areactively seekingto scale this discovery into commercial production.

Another initiative worthy of close attention is MTM Critical Metals’ pre-permittedfacilityin Texas, which aims to deploy a patent-protected process for extracting gallium from industrial scrap. Scheduled to begin operations in early 2026—an unusually rapid timeline for critical-mineral projects—the plant could provide the first domestic source of gallium recovered largely outside Chinese influence.

Importantly, MTM is reportedly negotiating binding agreements that lock in scrap feedstock and set minimum offtake prices with Indium Corporation, a leading U.S. supplier of purified gallium to semiconductor fabs. These price-floor provisions are expressly designed to shield the venture from Chinese market manipulation, offering a test case for how contractual innovation can complement technical advances in rebuilding resilient supply chains.

Meanwhile, industrial retrofit opportunities present low-hanging fruit for production scale-up. For example, Atalco’s Gramercy Refinery in Louisiana—the only operating alumina refinery in the United States—could support side-stream gallium recovery with relatively modest upgrades. Similarly, Nyrstar hastouteda $150 million effort to build a gallium and germanium processing facility at its existing zinc plant in Tennessee.

Despite these encouraging developments, warning signs prove why government backing is essential for long-term success. In October 2023, Nyrstar’s operations at its Clarksville zinc smelter—where it intended to install gallium and germanium recovery equipment—was put on indefiniteholdafter financing and engineering challenges delayed key milestones. The episode mirrors the fate of Australia’s Pinjarra gallium refinery, which was forced tocease operationsin the 1990s when low prices and a lack of policy support erased commercial margins. Both cases illustrate the importance of sustained government incentives, stable offtake contracts, and clear policy signals that strategic minerals production will be rewarded over the long term.

Rebuilding gallium supply chains at speed cannot be achieved through domestic sources alone. While establishing a reliable domestic supply is a reasonable strategic objective, it should be secondary to the urgent task of quickly developing large-scale gallium production outside of China. Ultimately, these efforts should prioritize projects that add gallium side-stream capacity at large-scale aluminum refiners, most of which are located outside of the United States.

Trusted partners in Canada, Australia, Japan, and Europe each bring unique capabilities and reserves that can narrow gaps in U.S. capacity. The recentdesignationof Australia and the United Kingdom as domestic sources for DPA funds was a critical step in leveraging allied advantages, but more international coordination with like-minded global partners is needed.

Canadaalready hosts North America’s only gallium producer, Neo Performance Materials. Although its operations are currently limited to recycling scrap inputs, it could help bridge the gap as primary production comes online. More significantly, Rio Tinto isexploringgallium recovery from alumina tailings at its Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean refinery in Quebec. If commercial-scale processing proceeds as planned, Rio Tinto could eventually supply 40 t of gallium annually—enough to meaningfully diversify North American supply.

Australiarepresents perhaps the greatest near-term opportunity for large-scale gallium production. Alumina refineries operated by South32 and Alcoa in Western Australia account for the largest such capacity outside of China, and given that gallium is recovered as a byproduct of alumina refining, these operations offer compelling economies of scale. Industry analysis suggests that building side-stream gallium recovery plants at these sites could be cost-effective and yield up to 40 t annually.

Separately, Nimy Resources isexploringsecure gallium supply chains for U.S. defense applications through a collaboration with M2i Global. The partnership reflects the value of demand-side signaling from the U.S. government to spur up-front investment from private firms.

Japan, in partnership with the United States and South Korea, has committed to strengthening critical mineral supply chains, including gallium, under a trilateral frameworkannouncedin June 2024. Japan has a long history of utilizing gallium in its advanced electronics industry and is among the largest producers of gallium outside of China. The agreement highlights the shared priority of developing enhanced refining and processing capabilities—critical steps in reducing dependence on Chinese intermediates.

Europealso shows signs of renewed momentum. Greek metals group Metlenplansto extract gallium as part of a €295 million expansion to its alumina production capacity, aiming for 50 t of gallium annually by 2027. This initiative has been designated as a strategic project under the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act, ensuring priority access to permits and financing. Meanwhile, Germany’s Stade refinery—once a major gallium producer—hasannouncedplans to restart operations by 2027, potentially adding another 40 t per year to the global supply.

However, whether these new sources of supply will be accessible to U.S. buyers will depend on the evolving global trade landscape. The Trump administration’s tenuous relationship with many traditional trading partners may cause political roadblocks, and European policymakers may seek to channel the material to their own clean-tech and defense sectors first. Proactive U.S.–EU negotiations on long-term offtake agreements will therefore be essential to lock in access before production comes fully online.

Elsewhere,Kazakhstan—while not a traditional U.S. ally or security partner—previously produced primary gallium at the Padvolar refinery up until the early 2010s. It has recently suggested that production will recommence, with a target of 15 t per year from the second half of 2026.

By doubling down on its gallium and other critical mineral restrictions, China’s leaders appear to have calculated that the country’s dominance over the global supply of minerals upstream of critical high-tech supply chains provides it with meaningful leverage over its rivals. Current trends reflect the worrying possibility that they could be right.

Ultimately, acting quickly to shore up these vulnerabilities is a critical test of U.S. and allied resilience against China’s emerging economic tool kit. Failing to respond effectively will send dangerous signals to Beijing about its ability to inflict asymmetric pain on the United States and allied economies. Fortunately, the United States and its global partners can take straightforward steps to neutralize China’s leverage.

If even a subset of the above international and domestic projects come online as planned, non-Chinese production capacity could grow by as much as 170 t—approximately 24 percent of current global supply. This would not only be sufficient to meet much of allied demand but could also help rebalance global pricing and undercut the effectiveness of China’s market manipulation.

To capitalize on these opportunities, policymakers should:

CSIS,The Hidden Risk of Rising U.S.-PRC Tensions: Export Control Symbiosis,"Published April 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/hidden-risk-rising-us-prc-tensions-export-control-symbiosis,"As the People’s Republic of China (PRC) retaliates to U.S. tariffs, it has not stopped at imposing its own taxes on imports of American products, which now stand at 125 percent for all U.S. goods. The PRC has alsotightenedexport controls on seven additional critical minerals,added28 U.S. companies to the export control list and 17 to theunreliable entity list, and instituted licensing requirements for seven additional critical minerals. At China’s export control work conference, China’s Ministry of Commerceindicatedthat they would “improv[e] the modern national export control system . . . by improving laws and regulations, strengthening management of listed items, enhancing licensing law enforcement, increasing multilateral and bilateral export control dialogues and exchanges, and promoting compliance.”

These actions are not simply short-term responses to U.S. efforts to strain the Chinese economy. Instead, they are a part of a larger shift in both U.S. and PRC policy toward using restrictions on exports as a tool of weaponized economic interdependence.

In recent years, China has increasingly wielded export controls as a strategic response to U.S. economic measures. Since Huawei and HiSilicon were put on the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List in December 2019, U.S. policy has prioritized the identification and exploitation of China’s economic chokepoints—often without fully anticipating the potential for Chinese retaliation. As a result, China is strategically building the tools to exert economic influence in ways that mirror U.S. strategies. As the United States considers future controls, it should carefully assess the risks to itself and its partners of a China increasingly willing and able to proactively leverage its own export controls against U.S. interests.

Utilizing the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ mapping of U.S. and Chinese export control evolutions, the chart below features four case studies spanning from August 2020 to February 2025. These examples provide strong evidence that China’s export control regime has largely evolved in direct response to U.S. measures, particularly the addition of Chinese firms to the Entity List, the enforcement of the foreign direct product rule, and the restriction of semiconductor sales to Chinese end-users.

In addition to the reactive nature of China’s export control regime, these case studies glean several other takeaways:

As the Trump administration looks to push on China’s economic chokepoints, it should carefully consider the ramifications of doing so. Both Washington and Beijing have asymmetric capabilities, and the United States has its own vulnerabilities which China can leverage. Even with artificial intelligence development—which has been the nucleus of U.S. export controls thus far—China has significant advantages. China benefits from its high-volume production of transformers, which are required for data centers, and from its market share of antimony, gallium, germanium, and indium, critical minerals necessary for semiconductors. These reciprocal dependencies should be a key factor as the United States conceives future export control strategies.

On a structural level, the expansion of U.S. export controls could result in China utilizing its nascent export control regime more proactively. Thus far, the United States has averted such a tripwire, but that would be stressed if Washington tries to cut Beijing off of U.S. legacy chips. In such a scenario, global trade would be reshuffled with both the United States and China rearranging global supply chains. Moreover, if Beijing were to proactively apply their controls, Washington would be caught on the backfoot, with limited ability for recourse.

To safeguard American economic interests while minimizing unnecessary escalation, the following actions should be considered:

Since President Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” on April 2, the United States and China have been inching toward an economic decoupling. Tit-for-tat responses have made way for targeted non-tariff rebuffs, including export controls. Disentanglement would ripple throughout third markets, leaving no countries unaffected. Despite the scale of this challenge, the offramps are shrinking and the tools of escalation are becoming more sophisticated.

As economic security takes center stage in both U.S. and Chinese foreign policies, the United States must navigate this evolving landscape with strategic foresight. A reactive approach risks deepening a cycle of retaliation that could disrupt global markets and weaken U.S. economic resilience. By incorporating a more nuanced assessment of vulnerabilities, maintaining open channels of communication, and preparing for shifts in Beijing’s legal system and regulatory strategies, Washington can craft a more balanced and effective export control strategy that safeguards national interests while avoiding unnecessary economic fallout.

CSIS,The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China Challenge,"Published April 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge,"The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakthrough technologies capable of leapfrogging the current state of the art, potentially destabilizing the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.

In October 2022, the Biden administration imposed controls on the export of designated types of semiconductors, some computer systems and assemblies containing those devices, and equipment used to fabricate those devices to China and to certain named Chinese “entities.” The stated purpose of the controlswasto limit China’s ability to obtain semiconductor manufacturing capabilities to produce ICs (packaged or unpackaged) for uses that are contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.” As detailed in areportby CSIS’s Greg Allen, the administration had several strategic goals:

The October 2022 controls weretightenedin October 2023 and December 2024. Following a major diplomatic effort, similar export controls were implemented by U.S. allies, limiting chip product and technology transfers to China. In March 2025, the Trump administrationimposedadditional chip export restrictions, blacklisting dozens of Chinese entities from trade in semiconductors and other advanced strategic technologies. In the immediate aftermath of the first rounds of chip export controls, it was evident that they were having a number of effects:

While the controls have had an impact, it has also become apparent that export controls cannot halt all exports of chip technology. Restrictions are potentially effective with respect to chipmaking equipment—which is commonly produced in small lots, is heavy, and is technically challenging to transport, install, and maintain. But semiconductor chips are produced by the millions and are small and easily concealed, and design software can very likely be moved across borders undetected. Chinese enterprises have already proven adept at smuggling proscribed chips through various forms of subterfuge.

These incidents, which came to light through happenstance, suggest the existence of larger traffic in smuggled high-end devices. In 2024, theNew York Timesreportedon an active trade in China in controlled AI technology, noting that in a “bustling market in Shenzhen . . . chip vendors reported engaging in sales involving hundreds or thousands of restricted chips.”

More importantly than smuggling, China is responding to U.S. and allied export controls with a whole-of-nation effort to make China independent of Western semiconductor technology. China has already demonstrated that export controls will not impede its capacity to innovate over the longer term. In 2019, the first Trump administration cut off Huawei’s access to U.S. technology, including semiconductors, a move that appeared to consign the Chinese telecommunications giant to irreversible decline. Instead, Huawei launched an effort to wean itself from reliance on U.S. technology, which has made rapid strides:

China’s drive for self-sufficiency in semiconductors is by no means limited to major players like Huawei and SMIC; it extends to previously little-known companies:

Until recently, the Chinese government has focused the bulk of its resources on supporting the chip manufacturing sector, assuming continued access to Western technology. To counter the current U.S. policy, it is now committing massive resources to the promotion of indigenous semiconductor research. China has already made significant progress. At present, itis producingtwice as many research papers as the United States on chip design and production, according to the Emerging Technology Observatory at Georgetown University. These efforts are destined to grow, insofar as China sees this competition as a struggle for national dominance, while the U.S. debates whether its companiesmeritsupport in the global “market” for advanced semiconductor development and manufacture.

The recent Chinese advances underscore a basic limitation in current U.S. policy. Export controls are relevant only so long as the United States and its allies possess chip technologies that China wants and needs. But it is rapidly becoming evident that Chinese firms do not necessarily require access to the most advanced Western technologies to achieve comparable chip competencies via new research or simply “workarounds.” The latter may not be as efficient—or as profitable—but they will enable competitive, “nearly as good” products able to meet Chinese needs while capturing market share and the revenue it entails to fund further investment.

Currently, Chinese engineers are undertaking novel approaches to chip design and production, which in some instances may well yield breakthroughs that both surprise and potentially destabilize the U.S. and allied chip industries:

These accomplishments highlight the need to monitor and assess the progress of China’s industry and the supportive policies and financial support for the industry. More information is needed,giventhat the scale, duration, and diversity of China’s efforts in this critical technology are not fully appreciated by U.S. policymakers.

Some U.S. policymakers may well view current chip export control policies through the lens of the largely successful effort to limit the flow of sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union during the Cold War competition. But that analogy simply does not hold. Many of the technologies at issue in the Cold War were usually physically large—for example, aircraft engines, discrete, and slow to evolve—the opposite of today’s semiconductors. Moreover, at the time, U.S. trade with the Soviet Unionwas largely limitedto U.S. exports of grain, a factor which greatly facilitated the enforcement of controls on technology exports. Supply chains have become so intertwined since the United Statesextendedpermanent normal trade relations to China in 1992 that it is often difficult to discern national boundaries, vastly complicating any effort to limit the flow of technology. Before, China displayed weak, if not backward, innovation capabilities, even for copying U.S. advances in information technologies. Now, China has become an innovation juggernaut in information technology and many other related sectors.

Western chip export controls have had some success in that they briefly set back China’s developmental efforts in semiconductors, albeit at some cost to the United States and allied firms. But current trends underscore that they are at best a short-term palliative for the long-term strategic challenge posed by China in this key sector. The United States and its allies can only address that challenge successfully through comprehensive support for their own chip industries, support that may well exceed the normal parameters of U.S. policy. The unprecedented chips legislation recently enacted in the United States and European Union is part of the response, but far more is needed, particularly expanded public investments in relevant semiconductor research to keep and develop a strong pipeline of well-trained engineers while supporting Western chip firms’ efforts to remain at the technological cutting edge. In the United States, a positive step is the newly formed National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology, which will be crucial to such an effort, promoting industry-government research and development via the National Semiconductor Technology Center. This effort and related programs will need substantial and sustained public support if the United States and its allies are to successfully meet this global challenge. It is a challenge the United States must meet.

CSIS,Understanding U.S. Allies’ Current Legal Authority to Implement AI and Semiconductor Export Controls,"Published March 14, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-us-allies-current-legal-authority-implement-ai-and-semiconductor-export,"Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it releasedtwo rulesthat added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued theAI Diffusion Frameworkand theFoundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, whichdirectedan effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology . . . to strategic rivals and their proxies” on its first day in office.

However, countries like the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan continue to control key chokepoints in the AI and semiconductor value chain, making unilateral action only so effective. Furthermore, the existing multilateral export control architecture is neither sufficiently flexible nor fast to allow for the kind of sophisticated, targeted controls that the United States has levied on China. The success or failure of the U.S. export control strategy is thus dependent on its allies’ ability to implement controls outside of this traditional architecture or U.S. extraterritorial regulations covering allies.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. allies’ export control authorities related to AI and semiconductor technologies and does the same analysis for China. It demonstrates that U.S. allies often do not have equivalents to U.S. export control authorities and tools like the FDPR and Entity List, but that they generally do have the capability to introduce some controls on advanced semiconductor chips and related equipment not covered by multilateral export control regimes. As a result, lack of alignment with the U.S. export control regime cannot necessarily be attributed to a lack of authorities alone. Allies’ enforcement capacity and willingness to act are also key ingredients in the implementation of effective export controls and are crucial to the success of U.S. and allied technology competition with China. Accordingly, the recommendations section of this paper addresses each of these three elements.

The paper proceeds as follows. First, it identifies key export control authorities used by the United States to slow the progress of China’s AI and semiconductor industries and analyzes which other countries possess these authorities and are thus capable of implementing similar controls. It then surveys the export control policies of key actors, including the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. It concludes by offering recommendations to U.S. and allied policymakers to make AI and semiconductor export controls more effective.

In December 2023, then–Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo clearlyoutlinedthe U.S. strategy for China and its AI ecosystem when she said, “America leads the world in artificial intelligence. America leads the world in advanced semiconductor design, period. . . . We’re a couple years ahead of China. No way are we going to let them catch up.” To achieve this goal, the U.S. national security enterprise has undertaken a massive, multifaceted effort tochoke offChina’s access to cutting-edge AI and related technologies.

Export controls on thehigh-performance semiconductorsused totrain and inferencestate-of-the-art AI models have been at the forefront of this effort so far. On October 7, 2022, the United States enacted a comprehensive set of export controls on advanced semiconductor technologies. Although these controls marked thereversalof nearly 30 years of trade policy, they did not achieve all of their intended goals. U.S. chip designers like Nvidiacontinuedto provide Chinese customers with slightly lower-performance chips, which according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), provided “nearly comparable AI model training capability.” In October 2023, the United Statesupdatedthese controls to cover a much larger set of chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). As noted in aprevious CSIS report, “The United States is firmly focused on retaining control over so-called ‘chokepoint’ . . . technologies in the global semiconductor technology supply chain.” The United States issued major export control updates in December 2024 and January 2025 that continued in this vein.

Despite the significant resources successive administrations have devoted to restricting China’s access to AI and semiconductor technologies, China’s AI ecosystem remains competitive with the United States’. In May 2024, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released a best-in-class open-weight model reportedlytrainedon Nvidia A100 chips stockpiled before the October 2022 controls went into effect. The even more impressive Deepseek-R1 reasoning model wastrainedon Nvidia H800 chips, which were notrestrictedbefore October 2023. The performance of DeepSeek-R1 was so far beyond what the financial analyst community had expected a Chinese firm to be capable of that the tech-heavy Nasdaqdropped3.1 percent in one day as a result of its release. Thisprevious CSIS paperprovides an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek and its implications for U.S. export controls.

At the core of the U.S. chip war strategy is a group of iteratively developed and highly sophisticated export control tools. Authorities granted in theExport Control Reform Act of 2018(ECRA),Export Administration Regulations(EAR), andexecutive ordersoffer the U.S national security community a range of options to control the export, reexport, transit, or transfer of select military, dual-use, and purely commercial items and technologies. In the House Committee on Foreign Affairs markup of ECRA, then–committee chairman Congressman Edward Roycestatedthat ECRA “closes gaps in our export controls that could permit transfers of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors to potential adversaries such as Beijing.” More accurately, ECRA represented the codification of U.S. export control powers that had previously relied onauthoritiesin the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and had anovel focus on emerging technologies.

The U.S. export control regime divides the responsibilities for administering and enforcing export controls on dual-use and military goods and technologies. The Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the flow of dual-use technologies and less sensitive military items, which covers advanced semiconductors and related technologies, through the BIS. Meanwhile, theDirectorate of Defense Trade Controls(DDTC) within the U.S. Department of State oversees and licenses weapons and munitions that are covered by theInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations(ITAR).The Office of Foreign Assets Control(OFAC) at the Treasury Department oversees restrictions on exports based on financialsanctions.

The four kinds of U.S. export controls most relevant to theTrumpand Biden administrations’ efforts to choke off China’s access to AI are described below.

In addition to these four export control types, there are three further export control features that require explanation to understand U.S. AI and semiconductor export controls.

The United States has also employed a range of other economic security tools to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductor technologies. For example, in August 2023 the Biden administration used IEEPA to issue an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department toestablish a programto review outbound investments in national critical sectors such as AI and semiconductors. This measurefollowedreporting that U.S. firms were investing in Chinese AI companies that were on the Entity List. On October 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Departmentissuedits final rule on the implementation of the executive order, which went into effect on January 2, 2025, but is now subject to review as a result of the Trump administration’sAmerica First Trade Policy memorandum.

However vigorously the United States pursues its own export control strategy, it will be unable to achieve success without changing the behavior of other countries. While the United States holds astrong positionin certain parts of the semiconductor value chain like chip design, other countries such as the Netherlands and Japan also play crucial roles in areas like SME. For example, Dutch company ASML is thesole providerof the latest generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines needed to make cutting-edge AI chips. The consulting firm Accentureestimatedthat the inputs to a typical semiconductor chip “could cross international borders approximately 70 or more times before finally making it to the end customer.” In other words, the United States does not control all the relevant chokepoints required to execute its export control strategy. In comments after the October 2022 controls went into effect, one U.S. officialtoldReuters, “We recognize that the unilateral controls that we are putting in place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don’t join us.” At the December 2024 Reagan National Defense Forum, Gina Raimondo reiterated this sentiment, albeit more forcefully,saying, “When I set the rules, I have to make damn sure China can’t just buy this stuff from Japan or Korea or the Europeans, so that’s why we have to work with them.”

Fully aware of this reality, Chinese officials have repeatedly threatened countries considering going along with the U.S. controls. For example, in a March 2022 interview, Tan Jian, China’s ambassador to the Netherlands,said, “This will not be without consequences. I’m not going to speculate on countermeasures, but China won’t just swallow this,” in response to the Netherlands’s increasing alignment with the United States on export controls.1

Unfortunately, U.S. allies have not kept pace with the United States’ increasingly restrictive export controls vis-à-vis China. While the U.S. export control system is designed to be able to keep up with technological developments and to be responsive to changing geopolitical circumstances, the regimes of its allies are generally not. As noted in the previous section, other countries with significant semiconductor industries have export control systemsgroundedin multilateral agreements primarily focused on WMD nonproliferation. These arrangements are significantly less agile than the U.S. system. For example, to add items to a Wassenaar Arrangement control listrequiresconsensus from all participating countries, and opportunities for additions typically occur only once per year. As Wassenaar also includes Russia, which has obstructionist geopolitical goals, findingconsensuson issues with geopolitical implications is unfeasible. In total, it can take up tothree yearsto add a new item to Wassenaar control lists, even under favorable circumstances. Furthermore, Wassenaar explicitly prohibits controls targeting an individual country,notingin its founding document: “This arrangement will not be directed against any state or group of states.” Limited improvements have been made to export control coordination between U.S. allies, such as the informal “Wassenaar minus one” approach, an effort by like-minded countries to harmonize controls on items and technologies not listed in traditional multilateral agreements.

But the existing multilateral export control architecture remains inadequate for U.S. national security requirements. As a result, understanding allied countries’ unilateral export control authorities is crucial to the success or failure of the U.S. and allied technology competition with China.

Allied countries possess significantly less comprehensive export control authorities than the United States. For the most part, they do not have an equivalent to key parts of the U.S. AI and semiconductor export control tool kit discussed in the previous sections like the FDPR, U.S. Persons Rule, Entity List, and restrictions that apply on a country-wide basis. This stands in radical contrast to China, which haspassedno fewer than five laws since 2020 devoted to building a more sophisticated arsenal of economic security tools. In fact, China’s most recent update to its Export Control Lawreplicatedseveral key U.S. export control authorities. The following sections compare U.S., allied, and Chinese export control authorities across list-based, end-user, end-use, and services controls.

List-Based Controls

All U.S. allies implement the list-based controls found in the traditional four multilateral export control regimes. However, as shown in Table 1, they generally do have the ability to implement list-based controls outside of those regimes as well. For example, while the European Union does not have the power to require the imposition of export controls on semiconductor technologies, underArticle 9 of 2021/821, EU member states are empowered to implement unilateral controls on otherwise uncontrolled items for “reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism,” or for “human rights considerations.” The Netherlands specifically referenced Article 9 authorities when it issued itsRegulation on Advanced Production Equipment for Semiconductorsin June 2023, which introduced a license requirement on the export of previously uncontrolled SME from the country. Similarly, when the Japanese government revealed its plans to place license requirements on 23 types of SME in 2023, it did so with authorities granted under itsForeign Exchange and Foreign Trade Actthat was originally passed in 1949.

Although allied countries do have the demonstrated ability to implement list-based controls unilaterally, it is misleading to think of their controls as equivalent to those issued by the United States. For example, no allied country has a meaningful equivalent to the FDPR, nor do they have controls on advanced node semiconductors that apply on a China-wide basis, with thepartial exception of Taiwan. On the other hand, recentchangesto China’s export control system have given Beijing the authority to implement list-based controls that apply on both a country-specific and extraterritorial basis.

End-User Controls

Multilateral export control regimes do not have an equivalent to the U.S. Entity List. As a result, allies have far less robust end-user restrictions than the United States. For example, the European Union and its member states simply do not haveend-user restrictionsand areforcedto use sanctions authorities to impose controls on specific entities. Table 2 summarizes the end-user control landscape.

While Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all have the authority to impose end-user restrictions, their end-user authorities are more limited than the U.S. Entity List. For example, Japan’send-user listonly contains entities involved in the development, production, manufacturing, or storage of WMDs, or certain military end-uses. No allied country has put end-user controls on Chinese AI and semiconductor firms like the United States has, at least not publicly. As with list-based controls, allied countries lag far behind China when it comes to end-user controls. For example, in October 2024, Chinareleasedits new dual-use export control regulation, whichoutlineda U.S. Entity List equivalent. Other regulations such as theUnreliable Entities Listalso give China options to target specific actors.

End-Use Controls

Multilateral export control regimes contain end-use (often referred to as “catch-all”) controls related to WMDs and certain military applications. For example, the Missile Technology Control Regimerequiresmembers to have end-use restrictions “controlling the export of items not included on a control list when they may be intended for use in connection with delivery systems for WMD[s].” Meanwhile, the Wassenaar Arrangement contains a“catch-all” provisiondesigned to control unlisted dual-use items destined for a country subject to an arms embargo and intended for “military end-use.” As shown in Table 3, allied countries’ end-use controls are thus confined to WMD and military applications, with the potential exception of the European Union.2

In contrast, in October 2022, BISintroducedan end-use restriction related to the production of advanced node semiconductors in China. This move marked a major policy change, as U.S. end-use restrictionshadpreviously been limited to situations involving WMDs. China also has the authority to implement end-use controls for reasons unrelated to WMDs. China’s 2020 Export Control Lawprovidesa catch-all for any end-use that likely would endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.” These terms are left largely undefined, providing Beijing with the ability to require licenses for a very broad set of unlisted items on an end-use basis if it desires.

Services Controls

Allied countries surveyed in this paper onlyapplyservices controls for WMD end-uses. However, there is a key difference in how the United States interprets what is covered under WMDs compared to its allies. In October 2022, BISinformedall U.S. persons that the act of supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors and related equipment in China “could involve ‘support’ for . . . weapons of mass destruction-related end uses,” and thus required a license. On the other hand, allied countries do notconsideractivities supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors to be related to WMDs and, as a result, do not imposes services controls on such activities. Table 4 summarizes the services controls landscape.

Despite holding a more limited view of WMD-based export control restrictions than BIS, certain allies do restrict their citizens’ activities related to semiconductor manufacturing through other economic security tools. For example, according to areportby the Semiconductor Industry Association, South Korea has used itsAct on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology“on numerous occasions to prevent firms transferring to mainland China technology deemed detrimental to the industrial competitive capabilities of Korean companies even in the absence of direct links to national security concerns associated with WMDs or conventional weapons.” Taiwan alsorestrictsits citizens and firms from supporting the Chinese semiconductor industry through a variety of regulations unrelated to its export control regime.

Key Gaps Between U.S. and Allied Export Control Regimes

As demonstrated in the previous sections, allied countries possess far less expansive export control authorities than the United States. Although they are all capable of implementing list-based controls on advanced AI chips and SME, their export control tool kit is far narrower than what is available to BIS. For example, while the list-based controls announced by the Netherlands and Japan as part of areported trilateral dealwith the United States were a legitimate breakthrough in allied export control coordination, their controls were weaker than the U.S. regime in at least three important ways. Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Kevin Wolfsummed upthese defects in his February 2023 testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which is quoted below.

[The trilateral deal does not impose] controls on activities of Dutch or Japanese citizens in support of advanced node manufacturing in China. (The new BIS rules prohibit U.S. persons from providing support, even involving uncontrolled foreign-made items, to the development or production of advanced node semiconductors in China.) It will not involve any ally imposing end-user controls such as those related to the EAR’s Entity List. It will also not have controls specific to the . . . production of semiconductor production equipment in China. Thus, Japanese and Dutch companies will still be able to export to China items and services that U.S. competitor companies cannot.

It is worth adding to Wolf’s point that license applications for sales of U.S.-controlled chips to Chinagenerally face“a presumption of denial.” Thus, the U.S. policy imposes what is de jure a license requirement but de facto a ban. This is not always the case for U.S. allies. For example, in July 2023 Reuters reported that Japan’s controlswould not be implementedon a presumption of denial basis.

Only imposing simple list-based restrictions leaves allied countries vulnerable to the same failure modes that plagued earlier versions of the U.S. controls. For example, in July 2019, Japan issued anupdateto its export licensing policies, which removed South Korea from its “white countries” list of trusted trade partners and required individual export licenses for fluorinated polyimide, hydrogen fluoride, and related chemicals. A February 2023 World Bank analysis showed that in the absence of an FDPR equivalent,Japanese firms simply relocated productionof the controlled chemicals from Japan to subsidiaries located in South Korea. While technically legal, these activities were in stark opposition to the intent of Japan’s controls and greatly limited their strategic impact. Similarly, for years the United States blocked direct sales of cutting-edge chips to customersexplicitly affiliatedwith the Chinese military, while allowing those same chips to flow freely to commercial entities in China. While this policy ended direct sales from U.S. companies to the Chinese military, it was mostly ineffective at stopping indirect sales to the shell companies that helped theChinese militaryevade export controls. The October 2022 controls addressed this by implementing restrictions that applied on a China-wide basis. Without equivalent measures, there are good reasons to think that allied countries’ controls will be susceptible to the same diversion risk.

The fact that the Netherlands and Japan used existing authorities to implement unilateral controls on advanced semiconductor technologies also illustrates that analysis of authorities alone yields an incomplete understanding of international semiconductor export control dynamics. Whether Japan and the Netherlands’s reticence can be attributed topoor diplomatic coordinationon behalf of the United States or alack of political willon behalf of its allies is up for debate, but it cannot be entirely attributed to insufficient legal authorities. What is clear is that this delay harmed the U.S. strategic goals vis-à-vis China and its AI and semiconductor ecosystem.

The Dutch and Japanese governments announced their plans to impose controls in line with the October 2022 update in March 2023, but enforcement did not take place until July 2023 in the case of Japan and September 2023 in the case of the Netherlands. This delay allowed Chinese firms to engage in a massive stockpiling effort. According to a Financial Times analysis of Chinese customs data, the total value of Chinese imports of SMEincreased from $2.9 billionin June and July 2022 to $5 billion over the same two months in 2023. The analysis further found that “most of the imports came from the Netherlands and Japan.”

The December 2024 export control updateshowedthat while U.S. policymakers are providing incentives to allies to align themselves with the U.S. export control regime, they are willing to unilaterally restrict the activity of firms headquartered in unaligned countries. For example, South Korean SME and high-bandwidth memory will be restricted by the expanded FDPR even for sales from South Korea, with a possible future exemption if the country implements controls equivalent to those in the United States.

The following sections survey export control policies for the European Union, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China.

CSIS,The United Arab Emirates’ AI Ambitions,"Published January 24, 2025",https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-arab-emirates-ai-ambitions,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is placing enormous bets on artificial intelligence (AI) to diversify its economy and become the world’s next technological hub. As the United States develops its strategy for global AI leadership, the UAE presents a critical test case for engaging with technologically ambitious countries seeking to balance relations with both the United States and China—a challenge that will shape the United States’ broader approach to technological partnerships and export control policies. In late 2024, a group of U.S. technology policy and national security scholars, including the four authors of this paper, traveled to the UAE to understand the country’s AI strategy, its position amid U.S.-China competition, and Microsoft’s $1.5 billion deal with Emirati national AI champion Group 42 Holding Ltd. (G42). The visit combined meetings arranged through the authors’ existing networks with those suggested and facilitated by the UAE embassy in Washington, D.C. This paper presents the authors’ following eight assessments about the opportunities and risks of U.S.-UAE cooperation in AI:

Global leadership in AI remains the United States’ to lose, but continued U.S. leadership is by no means assured. The United States can support Microsoft-led projects in the UAE while remaining cautious of endorsing the UAE’s broader AI ambitions. U.S. policymakers and AI executives should maintain a healthy realism about the UAE’s vested interests in hedging its bets between the United States and China. They should ask tough questions—such as what the Emirati government is doing to ensure decoupling from China in AI by tech companies other than G42—and scrutinize the UAE’s answers. For now, however, proceed with caution.

Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years have sparked a global race to develop and control the next generation of AI models, which a large and influential group ofsenior AI executivesandleading researchersbelieve will be a meaningful step toward human-level intelligence. If they are correct, such technology would have transformative implications for both U.S. national security and the global economy. Leading U.S. companies are making extraordinary and unprecedented investments, reflecting their belief that such a technological revolution is nearly at hand. For instance, according to October 2024 financial disclosures, tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are expected to surpass$300 billionin 2025 capital expenditures on AI—a projected 25 percent increase from 2024 and nearly double the 2023 figure. These four companies are hardly alone; in November 2024, Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly raised$6 billionto purchase100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units(GPUs, also known as AI chips) for the company’s Colossus supercomputer. In December 2024, xAI announced plans toexpand the facility to 1 million chips, which could require another $54 billion (assuming consistent chip models andpricing). Meanwhile, the United States and China are locked in a fierce struggle over critical elements of the AI and semiconductor supply chain and are accordingly investingtens ofbillionsannually in building domestic AI capabilities.

Against this backdrop, the wealthy and increasingly influential UAE has inserted itself into the global AI race. The UAE government hasidentifiedAI as a critical opportunity to diversify its economy for a post-oil future in line with global climate pledges. At the same time, the country’s strategic advantages—abundant energy, rapid construction, and close connectivity to markets in the rest of the Middle East and Global South—are highly attractive to U.S. AI companies looking toexpand AI infrastructure worldwide. U.S. and Emirati companies have already announced billions of dollars in partnerships. On January 21, 2025, OpenAI announced plans for a$500 billionprivate sector investment vehicle called The Stargate Project to build U.S. AI infrastructure for OpenAI alongside Abu Dhabi investment firmMGXand Japanese investment firm Softbank. In September 2024, MGX and U.S. firms Microsoft, BlackRock, and Global Infrastructure Partners also launched a fund for AI data centers and supporting infrastructure with an investment potential of$100 billion. Additionally, in April 2024, Microsoft announced a$1.5 billioninvestment deal with Emirati AI national champion Group 42 Holding Ltd. (G42). At a government level, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (also known as MBZ)metwith U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington in September 2024, culminating in abilateral AI cooperation agreementbetween the two nations. Emirati leadership has also participated ininvestment talkswith other U.S. industry leaders, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, to support a $7 trillion project to expand global AI infrastructure, including in the Middle East.

Someexperts in Washington view the United States’ growing partnership with the UAE in AI as a critical opportunity to compete with China. The United States’ lead in AI—especially in AI chips—could offer an opportunity to coax the UAE and other “swing states,” which are agnostic to U.S.-China competition, away from China’s sprawling technological reach. The Biden administration’sdecisionmakingrested on the assumption that foreign governments will be willing to jump through procedural hoops to access superior U.S. technology as they seek to develop their own indigenous AI capabilities. By offering access to U.S. compute power with strings attached—via export license conditions—the theory goes that the United States can regain geopolitical influence in regions where it is slipping. This bargaining position is particularly strong given that the United States can offer a comprehensive technological package—from advanced AI chips to cutting-edge models and cloud infrastructure—that China currently cannot match at scale. These export conditions could secure commitments not only for enhanced cybersecurity but also for the responsible development and deployment of AI. In the case of the UAE, this strategy has, for now, proven effective. In response to U.S. pressure, G42 hasreportedly divestedfrom Chinese technology firms,strippedChinese tech giant Huawei’s equipment from its data centers, and implemented strict security measures (see points two and seven of this paper) tosecureshipments ofNvidia H100chips to the UAE. The U.S. governmentreportedlyapproved the export licenses of these chips to a Microsoft-operated facility in late 2024.

Still, there are substantial risks to exporting large numbers of advanced AI chips to a nondemocratic country with strong ties to China and deploying leading U.S. AI models there. Unlike traditional technology transfers, AI chips can be accessed remotely, meaning their computing power could bedivertedeven if the physical hardware remains secure. Furthermore, hosting model weights abroad increases the risk of data exfiltration, particularly ifdata center securityand IT infrastructure prove inadequate. SomeU.S. lawmakershave raised concerns that such transfers could allow entities with connections to the Chinese Communist Party and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) backdoor access to U.S. AI technology and know-how, thereby evading U.S. export controls.

To address these concerns, the UAE has eagerly voiced its commitment to working with the United States in AI. In June 2024, UAE Minister of State for AI Omar Al Olamastated, “The honest truth is in the AI space today, I think we need to be selective of who we work with. . . . But on the AI front, I think there is going to be complete alignment between the UAE and the U.S.” At the Dubai GITEX Global Expo in October 2024, G42 CEO Peng Xiao, a former U.S. national whorenouncedhis U.S. citizenship for Emirati citizenship, similarlyremarkedthat the UAE’s relationship with the United States “cannot be stronger.” He added, “We’ve shown from [the] UAE side how transparent we are, and how we can guarantee the safety and security of this technology even when [it is] being deployed and used here in [the] UAE.”

The ultimate question is whether the United States can trust the UAE’s claims, especially when the stakes may be nothing less than leadership of a new geopolitical order. On the one hand, the United States must ensure that China cannot access U.S. technology and that the UAE is not simplyhedging its betsto secure the best AI chips it can obtain by playing the United States and China against each other. More broadly, if AI reaches human-level intelligence, the United States should be cautiousnot to offshoreits advantage too quickly. On the other hand, without rapid expansion of AI and energy infrastructurebeyond current U.S. capabilities—or a plan to entice emerging powers to choose U.S. technology over China’s—the United States risks losing its global technological lead altogether. These are the kinds of tough trade-offs that the second Trump administration, which hasvowedto “Make America First in AI,” must now face as it decides whether to continue approving export licenses to the UAE, at what rate, and under whatconditions.

In late 2024, a delegation of U.S. technology policy and national security scholars traveled to the UAE to better understand the country’s AI ambitions, its position amidst U.S.-China competition, and Microsoft’s deal with G42. Prior to the trip, CSIS experts identified stakeholders and arranged meetings with help and independently from the UAE embassy in Washington, D.C., and solicited input from the other delegation members. The UAE embassy also suggested government and private sector stakeholders that may be of interest for the delegation to meet, which the delegation was at liberty to accept or reject.

This paper presents the authors’ key judgments from the trip based on private interviews with top-level UAE government officials, senior Microsoft and G42 executives, a site visit to a G42/Microsoft data center, and conversations with U.S. and allied government officials. The paper concludes by presenting two strategic questions (point eight) to U.S. policymakers about engaging with the UAE’s AI ambitions in the future.

While many governments notionally aspire to be global leaders in AI, few are as genuinely serious as the UAE. Total Emirati AI investment is not publicly disclosed, but the figure is clearly in the many tens (to possibly low hundreds) of billions of dollars. In March 2024, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, G42, and the UAE state-backed Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Councilannouncedthe creation ofMGX, an AI investment vehicle expected to eventually reach $100 billion in assets. Six months later in September, MGX, together with U.S. firms BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Microsoft,launcheda global AI infrastructure fund with an initial $30 billion in private equity capital and $100 billion in investment potential. More recently, on January 21, 2025, OpenAIannouncedthat MGX will be one of the initial four equity funders for the new ‘Stargate Project,’ which plans to invest $500 billion in building U.S. AI infrastructure for OpenAI over the next four years.

Underpinning these investments is a real conviction that profound economic and social transformation from AI is near. Top UAE government strategists told the authors that the UAE aims to have 20 percent of its non-oil GDP come from AI by 2031, in line with the dates set by theUAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031, the government’s principal AI strategy document. The strategy projects that AI will contribute $91 billion (AED 335 billion) to the Emirati economy within six years.

Additionally, one foreign government official told the two CSIS authors that several UAE leaders are “true believers” in artificial general intelligence (AGI), a currently hypothetical scenario in which AI meets or exceeds human levels of intelligence across all or most domains. According to this source, UAE National Security Advisor and G42 Chair Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan believes that AI will be able to perform any human-level job in the near future and that this will be an economic and national security revolution. Though Al Nahyan has not made any public statements on this issue, he hasrepeatedlymetwith top AI executives who have been outspoken on AGI—including Microsoft CEOSatya Nadella, OpenAI CEOSam Altman, and Nvidia CEOJensen Huang—as part of ongoingpartnershipsbetweenG42, theUAE government, and the three U.S. companies. OpenAI’spress announcementof the Stargate Project, of which MGX is a key investor, concludes with the statement that “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI – and in particular AGI – for the benefit of all humanity.” Al Nahyan is the head of a reportedly$1.5 trillionsovereign wealth empire and embodies a tech-guru persona that puts him in the same orbit as many of the world’slargesttechCEOs.

Multiple UAE government officials told the authors that they see decoupling from China in AI as a critical condition for cooperation with the United States. In a private meeting, one top-level government official made this clear: “Working with the U.S. on sensitive technology—for that, decoupling is the right word. I think we have to do it; in that isolated part of our economy, it must be done.”

Several other officials echoed this sentiment. One high-ranking government strategist described cooperation on AI as a zero-sum game in the context of U.S.-China competition, stating, “We put all our eggs in one basket working with the U.S.” Another stated, “This relationship [with the United States] is very critical to us. We take the trust that the U.S. puts in us very seriously.” They concluded that, to meet its long-term goal of cooperating with the United States in AI, the UAE’s government understands that it must take action to enforce decoupling from Chinese AI technology in order to pursue its larger AI-related goals—even if it means hurting Emirati firms.

Emirati officials principally cited G42’s divestment from Chinese companies as evidence of decoupling from China in AI. Prominent U.S. national security officials have openlycriticizedG42’s ties to China, including its portfolio companies’ ties to Chinese military and intelligence firms, as well as Xiao’s personal affiliations with companies that contribute to Chinese military-civil fusion and human rights abuses. In January 2025,Wiredalso published afeatureon G42 Chair and National Security Advisor Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which detailed years of covert hacking and mass-surveillance operations orchestrated by the Emirati government and state-controlled firm DarkMatter to monitor journalists, human rights activists, and other members of state opposition. Following a public scandal in 2019, DarkMatter was dissolved and reportedly subsumed in large parts by G42.

To combat these claims, G42 argues that it has demonstrated its commitment to the United States by publicly cutting ties with China. As early as December 2023, XiaotoldtheFinancial Times, “In order for us to further our relationship—which we cherish—with our U.S. partners, we simply cannot do much more with [previous] Chinese partners.” Xiao added, “We cannot work with both sides. We can’t.”

Additionally, one senior G42 representative told the authors that G42 had “willingly” divested its passive investments in Chinese tech firms ByteDance, xFusion, and Honor in November 2023 to “disambiguate” G42’s position vis-à-vis China and demonstrate transparency. The statement supportsreportingfrom theFinancial Timesin February 2024, in which 42X Fund, G42’s $10 billion investment arm, told the outlet that it had “divested from all its investments in China.” G42 also said that it is taking pains to strengthen security measures in its data centers, including additional security controls (see points four and seven) and scrapping what one of its representatives told the authors was $1.7–$2 billion worth of Chinese hardware, including from Huawei, from its facilities (although one G42 representative admitted that a sizable portion of the Chinese equipment had already significantly depreciated in value by the time it was removed from the data centers). Microsoft officials told the authors that their staff have personally visited G42 facilities and seen Huawei equipment being stripped and discarded.

Still, there are several reasons to be skeptical of G42 and the UAE’s decoupling claims. For one, China has raised no public issue with G42stripping Chinese hardware from their facilities(a peculiar silence given its retaliation in response to similar actions from other countries in the past), which could suggest some kind of quiet agreement between the two nations. For another, in July 2024, Bloombergreportedthat G42’s divestments from Chinese firms were transferred to a new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle,Lunate. Lunate, like G42 and multiple Emirati sovereign wealth funds, is overseen by the UAE’s national security advisor. The transfer of investments raises serious questions as to whether G42—and the wider UAE—is serious about divesting from Chinese companies in AI. Lunate publiclyadvertisesthat it has $105 billion of assets under management, including oneS&P China/Hong Kong Exchange Traded Fundwithtop holdingsin Chinese tech companies Alibaba (27.7 percent), Meituan (18.9 percent), and Xiaomi (8.10 percent).

For another, it is not obvious to what extent the UAE is expanding decoupling from China in cutting-edge technology, including AI, to other major Emirati tech companies. G42 is undoubtedly viewed by the UAE’s government as a national champion. Through a deeply interwoven relationship between G42 leadership and the government, the company has become a symbol for the UAE’s AI development writ large. There are, however, other Emirati companies that merit scrutiny, particularly those working with U.S. and Chinese companies simultaneously. In March 2022, for instance, Huawei and UAE state-owned telecommunications companye&(formerly Etisalat Group)launcheda 5G cloud edge computing platform called 5G Edge Box. The announcement came just months after e& launched a similar 5G edge cloud computing platform with Microsoft.Accordingto Microsoft, the platform will deploy “Microsoft Azure Stack Edge to offer 5G, IoT, and AI applications.”

e& continues to collaborate with bothHuaweiandMicrosoftto provide 5G cloud edge networks. In February 2024, e& signed a newmemorandum of understandingwith Huawei to build energy-efficient networks in the UAE, whichstatesthat “e& will continue to work with Huawei to achieve network decarbonisation across its ICT infrastructure, including . . . data centers.” It is unclear from public statements to what extent Huawei’s “network decarbonization” of e& information and communications technology infrastructure could affect e&’s current or future U.S.-operated data centers in the UAE. For example, in October 2024, e& and Amazon Web Services (AWS)announceda $1 billion cloud agreement, which “combines AWS’s cloud infrastructure and solutions . . . with e&’s network capabilities.”

Furthermore,as of 2021, e& owns 40 percent equity in wholesale data center developer and leasing operatorKhazna, the main developer of Microsoft’s AI data centers in the UAE (described in more detail in point five below). G42 owns the remaining 60 percent and claims Khazna as aG42 portfolio company. Figure 1 illustrates G42’s portfolio companies and examples of foreign partnerships, and Figure 2 maps G42’s portfolio companies across the AI value chain.

Figure 2: G42’s Portfolio Companies Across the AI Value Chain

Outside the realm of technology, the UAE’s relationship with China runs deep. On November 1, 2024, China and the UAE celebrated their 40th year of diplomatic relations, marked by a publicstatementfrom Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he described the two countries as “good friends who trust each other and good partners for win-win cooperation.” UAE President MBZ likewise said, “The UAE remains committed to consolidating and developing a comprehensive strategic partnership with China.”Senior Emirati officials speak of a golden eraof Chinese-Emirati cooperation, a sentiment echoed by the Chinese ambassador to the UAE whodescribedthis as the “best period of time since we established diplomatic relationships in 1984.”

Indeed, China is the UAE’s top trading partner, with UAE government estimates valuing non-oil trade at$82 billionin 2023, a 34 percent increase from2021. Despite a show of partnership with the United States in AI, the UAE continues to work closely with the Chinese government and technology firms in sensitive areas such as5G,drones, and othermilitary technologies. For instance, the UAE’s Air Force and China’s PLA Air Force conducted ajoint military exercisein July 2024 in Xinjiang province, China, which may have allowed the PLA access to intelligence about Western combat aircraft capabilities. The joint exercise came just months before the Biden administrationdesignatedthe UAE a “major defense partner” of the United States, expanding bilateral defense and security cooperation through joint military exercises among other measures.

For these reasons, one top-level government strategist privately called the idea of a complete decoupling from China “anathema” to UAE policymakers. Because Emirati policy is driven by geoeconomics rather than geopolitics, the strategist said, the UAE will continue to develop a strong trade relationship with China at the same time as with the United States. UAE Assistant Minister for Advanced Science and Technology Omran Sharafpublicly statedin a November 2024 interview on AI and diplomacy that this delicate navigation between two great powers is what other third-party countries are “trying to learn from the UAE model.” While countries caught between U.S.-China competition are increasingly under pressure to choose between U.S. and Chinese technology and values, the “countries who are able to navigate that the best are the ones who get the most out of the opportunities that are there globally, whether economic or other areas that involve science and tech,” Sharaf said. This thinking suggests a more careful balancing of UAE diplomatic relations between the United States and China (including in technology) than the zero-sum commitment to the United States that other UAE government officials have described.

The UAE’s approach to decoupling from China requires careful distinction between rhetoric and reality. While G42’s actions demonstrate company-level separation from Chinese technology in AI, the broader picture is more nuanced. First, what constitutes the scope of this decoupling remains unclear—whether it applies narrowly to AI or extends to all advanced technology sectors such as 5G. Second, the transfer of Chinese investments from G42 to Lunate suggests more of a reorganization than true divestment. Third, other major Emirati tech companies continue to maintain simultaneous partnerships with both U.S. and Chinese firms. This selective decoupling approach is perhaps unsurprising—even the United States maintains extensive economic ties with China while restricting specific strategic technologies. The critical question is not whether the UAE will completely decouple from China, which would be an unrealistic expectation, but whether it can establish credible boundaries in strategic technology sectors.

The Chinese government and Chinese companies, notably Huawei, are reportedly spreading the message that U.S. delays in approving exports of AI chips to the UAE prove that the United States is a selfish and unreliable partner. One UAE government official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs privately noted that China is putting a great deal of pressure on the UAE government to lure them away from the United States in strategic tech, posing a tough diplomacy challenge for the UAE. Similarly, a senior Microsoft representative said that Huawei is trying to leverage the United States’ slow approval to ship semiconductors to the UAE “to the extreme” in its effort to get UAE officials back on board. The representative pointed to Huawei’s top“diamond” sponsorshipof the UAE’s flagshipGITEX Global Expo, held in Dubai in October 2024, as evidence that China has not given up on the goal of being the dominant AI supplier to the region.

One government official said that while Chinese technology is inferior to that of the United States, the UAE must get advanced technology fromsomewhereto boost its competitiveness. In late 2024, the Chinese firm Alibaba released a new open-weight large language model (LLM),Qwen2.5. Senior executives at two top-tier U.S. AI firms told one CSIS author that Qwen2.5’s release led them to dramatically reassess the extent to which the United States has a meaningful technological lead in AI. Specifically, one executive told the CSIS author that “the conventional wisdom that U.S. AI firms have an 18-month lead on Chinese firms is clearly wrong and needs to be updated.” Jack Clark, a cofounder of Anthropic,wrotethat “Qwen models outperform rival Chinese [computer code-generating AI] models from companies like Yi and DeepSeek and approach or in some cases exceed the performance of powerful proprietary models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI’s o1 models.” More recently, impressive jumps in theperformance of Deepseek’s ‘V3’ modelhavefueledconcerns about China’s advancement of frontier model capabilities. On January 21, 2025, former OpenAI Senior Advisor Miles Brundagetweeted, “Stargate + related efforts could help the U.S. stay ahead of China, but China will still have their own superintelligence(s) no more than a year later than the US, absent e.g. a war.” These statements are important because Emirati officials repeatedly stated in private meetings that their perception of U.S. technological leadership was the key reason for their willingness to decouple from China in AI technology. If the United States were to lose this strategic advantage, the UAE could decide to redirect its attention to Chinese technology firms, much like it did with 5G.

Still, UAE, G42, and Microsoft leadership cited several reasons the UAE would not—or could not—switch so easily. First, while China is making progress in some areas like AI models, the United States maintains critical advantages in the broader AI technology stack, particularly in advanced chips and the scale of production needed for large AI infrastructure. Model performance is just one metric of technological leadership—China continues to lag significantly in AI chip development and production capability due toU.S. export controls. These controls limit both the quality of chips China can produce and, critically, the quantity they can manufacture at scale, making it difficult for China to match U.S. capacity in providing the computing infrastructure needed for advanced AI development. While model performance comparisons may narrow, China’s limited ability to produce advanced AI chips at scale could preserve U.S. strategic advantage.

Second, one senior Microsoft executive argued that even if the UAE wanted to, switching back to Huawei AI infrastructure may soon become prohibitively technically challenging. Microsoft officials claimed that if the United States approves Microsoft’s exports of AI chips, they can “lock” the UAE into a U.S.-led technological ecosystem, allegedly due tohigh switching costsbetween different cloud and AI infrastructures as well asnetwork effectsfor AI-enabled software applications. Creating technological lock-in becomes particularly powerful when combined with China’s limited ability to provide comparable computing infrastructure at scale.

If this claim proves true, it would suggest that the United States could exploit its current technological lead to secure an enduring advantage over China in the next few years. The authors are not in a position to assess the accuracy of the executive’s claim definitively, and it should be regarded with some degree of skepticism: Large AI companies have deep pools of engineering talent that they could use to overcome lock-in, if necessary. Additionally, the fact that companies like Anthropic usemultiplecloudproviders for their AI models—with Anthropic even beginning to use AWS’s custom chips—suggests that while switching and working across infrastructure platforms may be difficult for many companies, it is not prohibitively difficult for those as well-resourced as Anthropic, OpenAI, or G42.

G42’s own strategy further illustrates this point: the company aims to “abstract the silicon away” through partnerships with multiple chip providers. It is already the largest customer of AI chip startupCerebrasand is running one of its clusters in California, while also recentlypartnering with Qualcommto procure AI chips. In several conversations, representatives from Core42, G42’s sovereign cloud and AI infrastructure portfolio company, emphasized their goal to build on top of different types of AI chips and abstract it away for their customers. This diversification of chip suppliers and infrastructure suggests that while AI chips alone may not provide an insurmountable competitive moat (though Qualcomm and Cerebras are both subject to U.S. export controls), offering a comprehensive technology stack—including chips, cloud infrastructure, and AI applications—could create more durable strategic advantages.

Several UAE government and AI company representatives readily acknowledged and agreed with the underlying reasons for the United States’ concern in exporting AI chips to the UAE in private meetings. Most notably, one UAE government official said that the UAE understands that the United States cannot “shoot itself in the foot” regarding AI. The official stated that the United States has a right to place restrictions given what the official described as the “dual-use nature” of the technology and the boost that it will give to military and intelligence capabilities.

On October 15, 2024, in a publicinterviewat the GITEX Global Expo, G42’s Xiao echoed the UAE government official’s words. Xiao was asked whether he felt that the United States is usingthen-proposed caps on chip exportsto some countries, including in the Middle East, as leverage for achieving its diplomatic goals. Xiaoresponded:

“I cannot read the mind of the U.S. policymakers, but in many ways, I understand their position. . . . When a nation, or even when a company or individual [has] invented a new technology, it’s only natural [that] you want to hold on to that edge . . . to make sure [that] because this new technology is so cutting edge, before you figure out how to properly use it, it cannot be possibly misused by others. So, in many ways, I understand that position [the] U.S. government has taken. At the same time from our side—we’ve shown from [the] UAE side how transparent we are and how we can guarantee the safety and security of this technology, even when [it is] being deployed and used here in [the] UAE. So, I think that door is opening up for us to do a lot more.”

Another top G42 executive privately agreed with Xiao, saying that he recognizes that G42 is not the target of U.S. export controls but rather “just collateral damage” in U.S. competition with China. The executive expressed support for an “N-1” strategy, in which the United States maintains exclusive access to the most cutting-edge AI chips for a certain period before allowing them to be exported abroad. The executive said that with sole ownership of the latest and most powerful chips for six months, for example, the United States could benefit from enhanced performance first and exercise greater control over AI diffusion.

Still, the executive said that G42 has implemented strict controls to demonstrate as much compliance and transparency to the United States as possible. According to Semaforreportingfrom September 2024, Microsoft-operated G42 data centers use military-grade encryption and are audited by U.S. Department of Defense contractors to test for potential security breaches that could be exploited by China. The Microsoft deal also reportedlyforbidsG42 from using Microsoft services or AI chips for surveillance and mandates that it seek permission from Microsoft to share the technology with other governments or militaries. On top of these controls, the G42 executive stated that G42 has applied even stricter security controls on its data centers than is required by the U.S. government and Microsoft (see point seven). According to G42 documents shared with the authors, additional controls include but are not limited to:

Many of these controls appear to be standard security measures commonly implemented by commercial data centers and major cloud providers. Without significantly more detailed information about their implementation—as cybersecurity effectiveness often lies in technical specifics—it is difficult to assess whether these controls represent meaningful improvements or adequately address the unique threats posed by state actors.

A G42 executive indicated that while these controls are necessary to demonstrate compliance and cooperation with the United States, they are placing a heavy financial burden on the company. The executive stated that “our costs are too high at the moment due to compliance,” which is causing G42 to lose customers to other companies without such strict controls. The executive concluded that they would like to see the United States standardize compliance requirements and apply them to companies around the world.

Multiple UAE government officials also voiced frustration that the United States’ tight restrictions are unjust given the UAE’s demonstrated willingness to play by the United States’ rules. One official said that the UAE’s categorization as a “D:4” country on theDepartment of Commerce Control List Country Chart(alongside countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Yemen) is unfair, objecting to being “grouped with our crazy neighbors,” given its demonstrated cooperation with the United States in AI and other sensitive technologies in the past. The official pointed to the UAE’s successful collaboration with the United States on space and nuclear projects as proof of this commitment to technological security. For example, in January 2024, NASAannouncedthat the UAE’s Mohamed bin Rashid Space Centre will provide crew members and an airlock module for its new lunar space station, Gateway. Similarly, in January 2009, the United States and the UAE signed a so-called123 Agreementfor bilateral cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy, which remains in effect today.

More broadly, UAE officials seek clearer guidance on pathways to improved country designation and more consistent, long-term policies that transcend changes in U.S. administrations. One official said that U.S. export controls are clear on an entity-to-entity basis but not at a countrywide level, making the government hesitant to take further action to decouple from China until the United States gives it a clear road map as to what it will take to move up the country designation list. Furthermore, this official said that the United States’ constantly changing export requirements makes real cooperation near impossible, stating, “We respect the U.S. system, we understand your concerns, but as a partner we need stability.” Another top-level official similarly stated that changes in U.S. administrations’ strategies toward China make it unclear how the United States expects the UAE and “countries like us” to navigate their relationship with both powers.

Officials stated that the recently announcedValidated End User program for data centersrepresents a promising step toward establishing a more predictable framework for technology transfers while maintaining necessary security safeguards. The U.S. government has since (in January 2024) announced aFramework for AI Diffusionthatbuilds uponthis VEU program, though this development occurred after the authors’ field research.

“It’s all inference, right?”

In the last year, Microsoft has faced considerable scrutiny from the Department of Commerce,Congress, and U.S.national security agenciesover its deal with G42 and its efforts to secure shipments of Nvidia AI chips to the UAE. This deal speaks to Microsoft’s evolving strategy for global AI leadership, which involves establishing a strong position in AI inference infrastructure to run AI models rather than an exclusive focus on training them.

Microsoft’s FY 2025 Q1earnings callon October 30, 2024, with CEO Satya Nadella provides some important clues to Microsoft’s views on the increasing importance of inference (referring to the general process in which an AI model is deployed post-training). In response to an analyst’s question about Microsoft’s strategy for investing in AI models, Nadella responded:

“Capital outlay for training . . . is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference in a given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would project the demand, and that’s what we would build it for. So, you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you’re building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand.”

Microsoft’s interest in AI models as a way to boost cloud inference demand may help to explain itspartial splitfrom OpenAI over the last year; at one time, Microsoft needed to jumpstart AI model demand for its cloud service to run models. However, as October’s earning call suggests, demand is now booming and self-reinforcing such that it might not require continued Microsoft investment and allegiance to an individual model maker. On a December 2024BG2 podcastepisode, Nadella went as far as to say that there will be no one AI model to rule them all in the future. Hesaid, “I don’t think it’s going to be winner-take-all. . . . The world will demand, even ex-China, multiple providers of frontier models distributed all over the world.”

Instead, Microsoft may view inference as the ultimate moneymaker in AI. In the October 2024earnings call, one analyst asked:

“Analyst:These models are getting bigger, more expensive, but you also pointed out how in the inference phase, we’re likely to get paid. How does that cycle look like in inference for Microsoft?

Satya Nadella:I mean the good news for us is that we’re not waiting for that inference to show up. . . . This is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it’s all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we’re not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that’s sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference. . . . We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot.

So, I feel the quality of our revenue is pretty superior in that context. . . . If this was just . . . a bunch of people training large models and that was all we got, then that would be ultimately still waiting . . . for someone to actually have demand, which is real.”

Nadella reported that Microsoft’s cloud platforms, including those used to offer AI services (and therefore “inferencing” AI models), are already driving total revenue growth. He said, “We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22 percent.” Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy E. Hood concurred that Microsoft “saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand, and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30 percent and 23 percent in constant currency.”

On theBG2 podcast episode, Nadella argued that the breadth of Azure’s geographical hubs and capabilities to handle a range of different workloads will be a competitive advantage for Microsoft in the future. He said, “There is going to be fierce competition between the seven, eight, nine, ten of us [hyperscalers] at different layers of the stack,” but that Azure’s structure makes it “slightly different” than other cloud providers. Specifically:

“We built out Azure for enterprise workloads with [a] lot of data residency. . . . We have 60- plus more regions than [other providers] . . . [and] we built [Microsoft] cloud for a lot of heterogeneous enterprise workloads, which I think in the long run is where all the inference demand will be.”

Microsoft’s view that cloud infrastructure for AI inference is where it will see enormous returns on investment—and that the more geographically and computationally diverse it is, the better—helps to explain the company’s push for global AI infrastructure, including in the UAE.

Microsoft’s Inference Bid in G42 and the UAE

Private conversations with Microsoft and G42 executives revealed that G42 and Khazna are building three new data centers in the UAE for Microsoft. The centers will be 30, 30, and 100 megawatts each, theequivalentof nearly 100,000 H100 chips (approximately 15,000, 15,000, and 50,000–60,000 respectively). These data centers will run Microsoft Azure for AI inference, helping to consolidate a regional Azure hub in the Gulf.

Microsoft and other leading hyperscale cloud and AI firms stated that—if U.S. AI chip export licenses continue to be rapidly approved—nearly all of them would consider UAE opportunities as attractive as, or more attractive than, those in the United States, especially in terms of realizing the goal of rapidly developing gigawatt-scale data centers. While the United Statesgrappleswith how to domestically build out energy and AI infrastructure on a scale comparable to theManhattan Project, Microsoft finds partnership with G42 and the wider UAE attractive for four key reasons:

U.S. AI companies arescramblingto secure long-term sustainable energy sources to fuel unprecedented data center growth, which theU.S. Department of Energy estimatescould consume approximately 6.7 to 12 percent of total U.S. electricity by 2028. While bottlenecks inU.S. energy infrastructurecurrentlythreatento place a de facto cap on AI development and deployment in the United States in the near future, the UAE’s capacity to build rapidly and its abundance of energy are incredibly attractive to U.S. AI companies.

The UAE has mobilized impressive capital in recent years to build out energy infrastructure, including for renewable energy, as it strives to meet its ambitious pledge to becarbon-neutral by 2050. In 2023, the UAE governmentannounceda $54 billion investment package to triple its renewable energy supply over the next seven years. Several large-scale renewable energy projects are already underway, such as the monumental Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, which is expected to reach5 gigawattsof installed solar capacity by 2030. Though solar power has historically been problematic for data centers due to fluctuations in supply (between day and night as well as seasons), developments in energy and battery storage capabilities are changing the game. In February 2024, for instance, UAE developer Moro Hubopenedthe world’s largest Tier III 100+ megawatt data center powered by solar energy in Dubai. U.S. companies Microsoft and Dell, as well as Chinese company Huawei, havereportedlyalready signed on to be customers.

Furthermore, thanks to a robust engineering and operations base from its oil industry, the UAE has an active labor force with strong technical know-how. As one UAE government official put it, compared to the United States, “we’re part of the world that still remembers how to build.” The official cited the speed at which the UAE builtfour nuclear reactorsfor itsBarakah Nuclear Energy Plantas a prime example: According to Emirati officials and theWorld Nuclear Association, the time between breaking ground on the first reactor and connecting the last reactor to the grid took just under 12 years. In contrast, construction of nuclear reactor Units 3 and 4 of the Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear power plant in the United States—the most recent nuclear reactors to enter commercial operation inJuly 2023andApril 2024, respectively—took 14 years and ran more than $30 billion over budget. The combined net capacity of Vogtle Units3and4(2,214 megawatts), meanwhile, is only just over half that of the UAE’s four reactors (5,348 megawatts), which it completed in two fewer years. The UAE is alreadyconsideringbuilding a second nuclear power plant, which government officials told the authors would likely take only seven to 10 years due to efficiencies learned during the construction of the first.

UAE investment in energy infrastructure translates to substantial gains in electricity generation capacity over the next decade. According to a2024 analysisfrom PwC Middle East, the UAE’s future electricity generation capacity (from amixof renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuel sources) will significantly outstrip future domestic demand. In 2025, PwC forecasts, the UAE will have 22.5 gigawatts of total generation capacity, while domestically consuming only 18.3 gigawatts. By 2030, capacity is expected to grow to 26.6 gigawatts while consumption remains a modest 21.2 gigawatts. Finally, by 2035, generation capacity is likely to reach 29.6 gigawatts while consumption rests at 23.2 gigawatts of electricity. If the UAE government decides to build a second nuclear power plant with the same specifications as the Barakah plant by 2035, total generation capacity could soar to 34.4 gigawatts. Figure 3 illustrates this trend:

Figure 3: Forecasted Excess UAE Electricity Generation Capacity to 2035 in Gigawatts (GW)

Though the UAE’s excess electricity generation capacity will not necessarily be directed solely to powering data centers in the UAE, even a fraction of this figure could be a considerable addition to AI infrastructure in the short term. Just 10 percent of excess capacity in 2030, for instance, would be enough to power over 500 megawatts of data centers (approximatelyequivalentto 300,000 H100 AI chips)—more than sufficient for the additional 420 megawatts of installed data center capacity thatKhazna projectswill be built in the UAE by 2029 (specifically 850 megawatts in 2029 compared to429 megawattsin 2024).

Of course, the UAE government could decide to dedicate only a small percentage of its excess electricity generation capacity to powering AI data centers over the next decade. But if AI is indeed the kind of national priority that UAE leadership claims it is (see points one and six), this figure could be a considerable strategic advantage for adding gigawatts of power to AI infrastructure in the next decade. As AI adoption grows, this advantage becomes even more valuable since serving millions of users is substantiallymore energy-demandingthan the occasional training of new AI models.

In October 2024, Khazna CEO Hassan Alnaqbiannounceda new Tier-III, 100-megawatt AI-optimized data center in the northern emirate of Ajman. The 100,000 square meter facility will include 20 data halls of AI GPUs using 5 megawatts of capacity each and will be built on an accelerated timeline of 15 to 18 months. In private conversations, Khazna and G42 executives confirmed that the center is being built for Microsoft.

Construction of the 100-megawatt facility is reportedly expected to cost$272 million. According to Alnaqbi, the average cost of construction per megawatt for a group of new Khazna data centers will bebetween $8 million and $12 million. For comparison, 2024 U.S. market data shows that the average construction cost of U.S. data centers ranges from$10 million to $11 millionper megawatt and is projected to increase 5 to 7 percent annually. In terms of total construction costs, one 2023 survey of the global data industry estimates that the average price (excluding hardware) of a 20-megawatt data center typically fallsbetween $100 million and $200 million. Moreover, construction of a 100-megawatt data center can exceed $1 billion. Therefore, if Khazna’s construction estimates are correct, they would be almost four times cheaper than the global average.

The first part of the Microsoft-G42 deal is to develop a sovereign cloud for the UAE government and public sector using Microsoft Azure and G42-Khazna construction capabilities. In September 2023, Microsoftannounceda partnership with G42 to “unlock new opportunities for digital transformation with joint sovereign cloud and AI offering.” The announcement states:

“Microsoft’s sovereign cloud offering will allow UAE public sector and regulated industries to use new platform capabilities for securing sensitive data, providing access to the latest cloud and AI features available on Azure public cloud and helping them comply with local privacy and regulatory requirements. G42’s deep understanding of UAE sovereignty requirements and technical capabilities are central to customizing the offering to help address customer’s specific needs.”

Microsoft reaffirmed this commitment in the more recent$1.5 billion dealwith G42 from April 2024. The Aprilpress releasestates that “G42 will run its AI applications and services on Microsoft Azure and partner to deliver advanced AI solutions to global public sector clients and large enterprises,” as well as “to introduce sovereign cloud offerings and collaborate on unlocking the potential of advanced AI capabilities on the Azure public cloud platform.”

In private meetings, G42 stressed that the Azure sovereign public cloud platform remains central to the new G42-Microsoft partnership. This platform is codeveloped between Microsoft andCore42at the AI compute and cloud platform layers of the AI value chain (see Figures 1 and 2). G42 executives explained that G42 and the UAE government want to expand local data center capacity inside the UAE so that they can store and process sensitive data that, under UAE laws, is not permitted to leave the country. Moreover, Core42softwarebuilt on top of Microsoft Azureconfidential computeencrypts all data, helping to strengthen theUAE’s data sovereignty. Specifically, any data running on the Core42-Azure stack in the UAE can be accessed—but not read—by foreign governments using extraterritorial authorities over cloud providers overseas, such as the United States’CLOUD Actor China’sData Security and Personal Information Protection laws. As a result, one G42 representative said that G42 can technically comply with foreign data laws while simultaneously protecting sensitive “sovereign” data by making it illegible. In return, for Microsoft, UAE companies generating data (including G42’s own companies) will become Microsoft customers, offering Microsoft the opportunity to lock in demand for its cloud services.

G42 executives highlighted G42’s healthcare portfolio company,M42, as a case study of this dynamic. M42 is creating databases of Emiratis’ biometric data as part of a government-sponsoredgenome sequencing projectto improve healthcare diagnostics and drug discovery in the UAE. M42 has collected approximately 700,000 DNA samples thus far—an extraordinary amount of data that requires storage and management and that offers the opportunity for extensive AI analysis. Under theUAE’s Health Data Law, however, in the absence of specific government authorization the storage and processing of health data must take place within the country. Additionally, the sensitive nature of the data means that the UAE wants to host the data on secure encrypted cloud servers that prevent the data from being accessed by foreign governments. As a result, the UAE government and the regulated companies are eager to expand sovereign data center capacity inside the UAE.

G42 executives told the authors that M42’s genomics project is already consuming vast amounts of G42’s local data center capacity and indicated that the firm would be a strong and rapidly growing customer for Microsoft’s new cloud facilities. As the UAE strives toexpandits healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, it will require even greater capacity to store and process data on encrypted platforms. More broadly, G42 and the UAE’s many other companies that handle other forms of sensitive data, such as its space technology companySpace42, will likely become strong customers for Microsoft Azure public cloud in the future. This all suggests that Microsoft will secure customers for its planned data centers in the UAE with little trouble.

In addition to capturing high-demand customers for Azure, Microsoft hopes to become the first and best developer of AI applications that stimulate network effects toward its services.The network effectdescribes the concept that the more people use a service or product, the more valuable it becomes. It is frequently used in relation to e-commerce or social media platforms, where the quality of the service grows as more users become members. Additionally, the more people use a particular product or service in an individual’s social or professional network, the more likely they are to use it, too, creating a reinforcing cycle.

Over the last30 years, the network effect has helped to make Microsoft’s Office suite thedefault operations platformfor businesses worldwide. Entrenched norms and efforts to make business software interoperable have ensured that Microsoft products like Word and Excel have become the backbone of the professional world. Through technological diffusion—and not just innovation—Microsoft has become the world’slargest tech companiesin terms of market capitalization.

Microsoft would like to reproduce this kind of effect with its consumer and enterprise AI products in the future. Nadella acknowledged this as a Microsoft strategy on the December 2024 BG2 podcast, where hesaidthat “network effects is always going to be at the software layer, at the app layer,” and that there will be “different network effects in the consumer [sector and] the enterprise [sector]” due to different demands for its products, such as Microsoft Copilot for consumers and GitHub Copilot for software developers.

Microsoft executives told the authors that their ultimate hope is to supply emerging markets with their products before Chinese technology firms can get there first. Should Chinese firms overcome U.S. export controls and produce superior AI products (and be able to offer them at scale), they will still face the challenge of competing with an established incumbent across the developing world. Even if a Chinese application is technically better, network effects could ensure that Microsoft customers remain loyal to their products. For this reason, Microsoft is eager to jumpstart a virtuous cycle of demand for its AI products in the UAE and abroad.

Another key element of the April Microsoft-G42 deal is the expansion of Microsoft’s AI services to the developing world.Microsoft’spress statement about the deal is specifically titled: “Microsoft invests $1.5 billion in Abu Dhabi’s G42 to accelerate AI development and global expansion.” In private conversations, Microsoft and G42 executives stated that, like the UAE, many governments in the Global South are looking to develop their own public clouds that will store and process data locally in line with national laws (see point 5.3. above). They see this as a critical opportunity for Microsoft to expand its Azure cloud services and for G42 to finance and build out the data center infrastructure abroad. Microsoft’spress statementsuggests as much:

“G42 and Microsoft will collaborate to ensure the benefits of secure AI technologies and cloud capabilities are responsibly shared with growing economies. . . . G42 and Microsoft will also work together to bring advanced AI and digital infrastructure to countries in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, providing these nations with equitable access to services to address important governmental and business concerns while ensuring the highest standards of security and privacy.”

Public announcementsby G42 and Microsoft have already confirmed that one of these countries is Kenya (see below). Though other countries have not been confirmed under the deal, agreements from 2021 and 2022 between G42 and thegovernment of Kazakhstan, as well as private and state-owned infrastructure companies inEgyptandIndonesiamake these likely contenders for expanding Microsoft Azure with G42.

Microsoft and G42’s work in Kenya, which includes developing a1-gigawatt data centerand building aSwahili language AI model, is the first step in this global expansion project. This project began in March 2024, when G42, without Microsoft,announceda partnership with Kenyan firm EcoCloud to build a 1-gigawatt data center in Kenya, “powered by the untapped potential of Kenya’s 10 gigawatts in geothermal energy.” According to the press release, the facility would start at 100 megawatts before scaling to 1 gigawatt to “usher in an era of cloud computing and AI services” in Kenya. Kenyan President William Samoei Rutoreportedlysupported the dealpersonally. It was only later, in May 2024, that Microsoftannouncedit would join this venture with G42. One top G42 executive privately said that Microsoft’s senior leadership had been “inspired” by G42’s plans in Kenya and “saw the opportunity” to expand Microsoft’s business in the Global South. Microsoft executives likewise confirmed that this was a pivotal moment for the company’s top executives, leading them to give G42 $1.5 billion. G42 executives told the authors that the company was not initially looking for capital investment from Microsoft, only a partnership agreement.

Under the second May 2024agreementwith Kenya, Microsoft and G42 will commit an initial investment of $1 billion in expanding Kenya’s digital ecosystem, in which “one of the Kenyan investment priorities is a state-of-the-art green data center that will be built by G42 and its partners to run Microsoft Azure in a new East Africa Cloud Region.” The public announcement states that Microsoft and G42 will specifically:

“Work with the government of Kenya and will design and operate the new East Africa cloud region as part of a ‘trusted data zone’ based on global standards to protect digital safety, privacy and security. With technical assistance and support from G42 and Microsoft, Kenya will establish the new data center . . . under which data from other countries may be governed by their local laws, even while stored and resident in Kenya.

Kenya will utilize the new data center and cloud services for governmental and citizen services.”

Both G42 and Microsoft executives told the authors that they see this project as the first step to expanding services to many other governments with similar sovereign needs as the UAE.

Microsoft executives expressed significant enthusiasm about what this partnership with G42 could mean for increasing U.S. influence in middle and emerging powers vis-à-vis China. Though they acknowledged the U.S. national security concerns raised by the Microsoft-G42 deal, they argued that in its absence, Chinese technology companies would have snapped up the opportunity to provide AI infrastructure to the UAE. More broadly, the partnership offers an opportunity to rebuff Chinese technology companies’ dominance of critical technology infrastructure in Africa. In recent years, for instance, leading Chinese tech firms like Huawei and ZTE Corporation have developed AI-enabled“smart city” infrastructure and surveillance systemsin countries across the African continent, including Kenya. “If the U.S. has the chance to win over Africa [against China], it’s because of what we’re doing here,” one Microsoft executive said.

OnJanuary 3, 2025, Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith called the “promotion of American AI exports” a “critical priority” for U.S. policymakers and companies in the next year. “The rapid development of China’s AI sector has heightened competition between American and Chinese AI, with much of this likely to play out during the next four years in international markets around the world,” Smith wrote. Moreover:

“While the U.S. government rightly has focused on protecting sensitive AI components in secure datacenters through export controls, an even more important element of this competition will involve a race between the United States and China to spread their respective technologies to other countries. Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the U.S. and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover. Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world.”

Multiple Microsoft, G42, and UAE government representatives stressed that the UAE has the diplomatic clout and available capital to become a “gateway to the Global South” for U.S. companies. With closer ties to developing countries than the United States has and enormous capital reserves, the UAE government and companies like G42 could effectively “derisk” U.S. companies’ entry into new markets, they argue.

The UAE committed$97 billionin foreign investment to Africa in 2022 and 2023—three times the amount of Chinese investment in the continent over the same period. It also became aBRICS+ memberin 2024, joining a club of emerging economies anticipated to represent 45 percent of global GDP in purchasing power terms by2040. According to the World Trade Organization, BRICS+ members already represent approximately25 percent of global exports, with the UAE second only to China (and 14th globally) as the largest exporter among BRICS+ countries at 2.1 percent of the global share.

At the GITEX Global Expo in October 2024,G42’s Xiaopresented the concept of an AI “intelligence grid” similar to today’s electric utility grids. He said:

“As intelligence, through the form of artificial intelligence, becomes a utility, it becomes as important, if not more important than electricity. . . . That means we have to build the intelligence grid—the equivalent of [an] electricity grid; the data centers, connectivity, the computing infrastructure for inferencing, to be able to pipe that intelligence-as-utility to everyone who needs it.”

Xiao estimates that the world today has less than 60 gigawatts of data centers but will need between 300 and 500 gigawatts to spread AI across the globe, with each gigawatt of data center and energy infrastructure costing $45 billion. According to studies of AItrainingandinfrastructurecosts and the authors’ calculations, AI chips account for nearly half of this total cost at approximately $20–$24 billion per gigawatt. Xiao further said, “That’s a type of infrastructure we’ve got to build for the world to be able to take advantage of AI and to benefit all humanity. And for me, that’s the greatest opportunity.”

G42’s deal with Microsoft to build two 30-megawatt and one 100-megawatt data center in the UAE is only the beginning of a much bigger project to spread “intelligence-as-utility” worldwide. In a private meeting, one senior G42 executive said the company wants to build gigawatt-scale data centers because “we think this [ability to rapidly and cheaply build large energy and data center infrastructure] could be our competitive moat.” Specifically, G42 and Khazna’s speed and cost-effectiveness of construction and the UAE’s abundance of energy are great advantages in domains where the United States and the rest of the world are struggling to compete.

Khaznareportedlyalready has 360 megawatts of data center capacity spread over 24 centers in the UAE, with another eight under construction. Khazna’s Alnaqbi has publiclystatedthat “based on the demand we have . . . we expect the UAE to ramp up and accelerate demand to at least 850 megawatts by 2029” (see point 5.1). However, private discussions with G42 executives indicate that G42’s ambitions to build out AI infrastructure—with or without Microsoft as their partner—far exceed this number:

Top G42 executives told the authors that they think they will be able to generate around 5 gigawatts of data centers within the UAE, most of which will be used for AI deployment. They did not provide a timeframe for building out this capacity but implied that Microsoft may not be their only partner if it cannot fill these data centers quickly enough once they are constructed. They did not suggest which other companies G42 might pick as additional or alternative partners to Microsoft.

While in the UAE, the authors toured a 21-megawatt data center built by G42 and Khazna for Microsoft. Security controls installed in this center to address cybersecurity, insider threat, and break-in risks includeNIST SP 800-53 controls, over 100SP 800-53 security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations, and Department of Commerce export license requirements. The authors of this paper are not in a position to fully verify G42’s claims about its broader security controls, though the implementation of these commercial security standards appeared consistent with typical industry practice and is plausible.

A key question, however, is whether these measures are wholly sufficient. Standard data center security measures typically addressprivacy and cybercrimeissues rather than full-fledged attacks from nation-states like China. As AI capabilities advance and the stakes increase, U.S. and UAE commercial security standards may need significant enhancement to address evolving threats from state actors. ARAND analysisindicates that securing AI model weights and related intellectual property requires significantly higher security standards than what current AI companies or cloud providers—whether in the United States or the UAE—are currently achieving. While cybersecurity measures are currently a primary focus due to the risks of deploying model weights abroad and potential exploitation by adversaries, compute providers could play a muchbroader rolein ensuring secure AI development.

Furthermore, cybersecurity represents only one dimension of the challenge. Today’s risks extend beyond traditional export control concerns about the physical location and ownership of AI chips. Critical considerations include how compute resources are being used, who can access them remotely, and how resulting AI models and weights might be shared or deployed. Even when AI chips are physically secure within a facility, their computational power can be accessed remotely, and trained models can be distributed widely—potentially to unauthorized users. This requires robustknow-your-customerprocedures and comprehensivemonitoring of compute usage patterns, capabilities that current security frameworks may not adequately address.

If the United States deems the current controls inadequate for protecting U.S. technology in Emirati data centers or elsewhere, it should clarify what additional controls may be required and where.

The United States can support Microsoft-led projects in the UAE while remaining cautious of endorsing the UAE’s broader AI ambitions. If Microsoft’s claim that cloud infrastructure can create significant lock-in and network effects for its cloud services is true, then supporting the Microsoft-G42 deal could strengthen U.S. technological leadership and make switching to alternative providers (like Huawei) increasingly costly. This “stickiness” of cloud platforms could help cement U.S. dominance in global AI infrastructure while providing a model for future partnerships with other emerging technology powers. The newU.S. Framework for AI Diffusionfurther reinforces this advantage by allowing U.S. companies like Microsoft to obtain Universal Validated End User status, enabling them to deploy data centers globally with a single license, whereas local companies in the UAE would require an authorization which is country specific and subject to more stringent caps. As Chinese technology firms continue to strengthen their presence in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia—which is increasingjoint ventureswith companies likeAlibabaandSenseTime, and recently invested$400 millionin AI startup Zhipu AI—developing such a model for U.S. foreign engagement on AI is more important than ever.

However, the United States should also bear in mind that today’s cooperation could evolve into tomorrow’s competition. At the GITEX Global Expo, for instance, UAE Adviser to the President and Secretary-General of the Advanced Technology Research Council Faisal Al Bannai said:

“I think the opportunity we have, as UAE, and as the stakeholders here in the country [is]: One, you can leverage all the good technologies that are coming out, let’s say from the U.S., right? The different partnerships that are happening with G42, Microsoft, [and] a number of other entities. But at the same time, we are also building our own AI platforms—something that we control, we own, and we can take progress from.”

The UAE has already made a significant effort to develop indigenous LLMs such as G42’s Arabic-English LLMJaisand the government-backed Technology Innovation Institute’sFalcon 2, which the instituteclaimsoutperforms Meta’s Llama 3 model. Private conversations with UAE technology and business professionals revealed that, in reality, these Emirati models perform poorly compared to U.S. models. They said Emirati models are not reliable nor high performing enough for many industry use cases, and that they currently use U.S. options in their work. With increasing access to U.S. compute and talent, however, the United States should think through a scenario in which indigenous Emirati models—controlled exclusively by a nondemocratic government with significant ties to China—become real global competitors. If the next world order is indeed determined by who wields the best AI systems, then the decision to equip other countries with the fundamental ingredients to develop this technology (i.e., chips) should not be taken lightly. Even if the UAE remains faithful to its promise to exclusively partner with the United States in AI, it has said little so far about what a world in which it has outgrown this partnership might look like.

U.S. leadership of the global AI ecosystem is at a critical turning point. Recent developments in China’s AI models have caused several leading AI executives to outright reject the belief that the United States still holds an 18-month lead on China in AI development. At the same time, Chinese technology firms’ investment and infrastructure projects in emerging economies threaten to lock the United States out of economically and geopolitically strategic markets in the Global South. However, China’s ability to produce advanced AI chips at the scale needed to support broad AI deployment could remain significantly constrained by U.S. export controls, limiting their capacity to backfill U.S. technology.

While renewing U.S. industrial policy and onshoring supply chains is a frequent policy priority in Washington, these policies should not be pursued at the expense of expanding a U.S.-led AI ecosystem abroad. Similarly, rigid restrictions on the deployment of U.S. AI technologies exclusively in the United States and its allies will do little to further U.S. influence in the many “swing states” that are unlikely to pick sides in the U.S.-China competition.

Rather, reaffirming the United States’ leadership in AI requires a comprehensive strategy: ensuring emerging powers choose U.S. technology to realize their AI ambitions while establishing robust frameworks for secure and responsible deployment. The traditional approach of simply selling technology without ongoing oversight is insufficient given the unique characteristics of AI systems—their remote accessibility, the sensitivity of model weights, and the potential for unauthorized sharing or deployment.

There will always be inherent risks to offshoring AI to countries outside the United States, let alone to nondemocratic ones with strong ties to China. Thus far, the United States’approvalof relatively modest clusters of advanced AI chips to G42 indicates that the potential benefits—both commercial and strategic—outweigh the risks. However, as the U.S.-UAE partnership evolves, U.S. policymakers and AI executives should maintain a healthy realism about the UAE’s vested interests in hedging its bets between the United States and China. They should have no illusions about the nature of the Emirati political regime, nor about some of theusesto which the UAE is likely to apply its AI technologies. They should ask tough questions, such as what the UAE government is doing to ensure decoupling from China in AI by tech companies other than G42, and scrutinize the UAE’s claims about these and other security measures. If they do not think that the current security controls for AI chips are sufficient to protect the United States’ advantage, they should articulate clearly and consistently what those controls should be. For now, however, proceed with caution.
