Politico,"Commerce to launch Section 232 semiconductor probe ",2025-04-13T12:13-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/13/commerce-launch-section-232-semiconductor-probe-00287938,"The investigation could lead to new tariffs on semiconductors in a move that would have sweeping implications for Asian countries and the tech sector.

President Donald Trump is preparing to instruct the Commerce Department to launch an investigation that could lead to new tariffs on semiconductor technology in order to protect national security, a White House official confirmed to POLITICO.

The action sets the stage for more friction between the U.S. and major economies in East Asia, where the U.S. gets most of its chips, such as Taiwan, and would have sweeping implications for major U.S. technology companies that rely on chip imports.

South Korea, Malaysia and Japan are also key players in the semiconductor supply chain, including in chip assembly, testing and production. China is the world’s largest semiconductor market in terms of consumption.

The investigation will be launched under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to restrict imports deemed a threat to national security, the official said, who was granted anonymity to discuss developing plans. The official added that the purpose of the investigation is to “revive U.S. manufacturing in critical technologies.”

Commerce currently plans to allow a public comment period, they said. Those types of probes usually take up to 270 days to complete, although the White House has signaled the investigation could follow a faster timeline.

Trump has already launched Section 232 investigations into the copper and timber industries over the past two months and used the findings of a Section 232 investigation from his first term to justify expanding steel and aluminum tariffs in March.

The president has also said tariffs on semiconductors would start at around 25 percent and that those rates would climb“substantially higher” over the course of a year. Trump has mentioned sectoral tariffs could additionally be applied to more products including pharmaceuticals.

The semiconductors probe could come days or weeks aftersome electronics imports were exemptedfrom Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs,” according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection notice posted Friday. “This is not like a permanent sort of exemption,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaid on ABC’s “This Week”on Sunday.

New duties on semiconductors would only be the latest in a steady drumbeat of tariffs the president has imposed during the first months of his second term.

The White House has already imposed 145 percent tariffs during Trump’s second term on China, in addition to existing tariffs on the country. While a universal 10 percent tariff on nearly all other countries remains in effect, higher tariffs could return if Trump is unable to make dozens of separate deals with countries within his self-imposed 90-day deadline.

Sen.Elizabeth Warren(D-Mass.) panned Trump’s tariff strategy for a lack of coherent strategy on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing red light, green light with tariffs,” Warren said."
Politico,‘Semiconductor slush fund’: How the Trump admin seized control of Biden’s $7.4 billion chips initiative,2025-09-30T05:00-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/lutnick-natcast-chips-biden-00576779,"Accounts from more than 50 people paint the most extensive look yet at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s sudden rethink of a major Biden-era chips initiative and the fallout.

SAN FRANCISCO — A $7.4 billion tech initiative devised as the linchpin of America’s semiconductor resurgence is in limbo after the Commerce Department abruptly yanked its funding, triggering mass layoffs and pushing a group the Biden administration chose to lead the effort to the brink of shutdown.

Natcast, which brought together premier chip companies and research universities, had amulti-billion-dollar contractto secure the United States’ place as the epicenter of advancements in semiconductors. President Donald Trump and lawmakers from both parties still recognize the directive as essential in the global technology race with China.

The Silicon Valley-based nonprofit was little-known until Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently derided it as a “semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars.” Lutnick based his incursion on charges that the organization is not onsound legal footing, saying his goal was to keep control of federal funds.

POLITICO spoke with more than 50 people — many of whom requested anonymity to avoid potential retaliation — for the most extensive account to date of the fallout from hisbombshell decisionto reclaim the billions of dollars approved under former President Joe Biden.

The conversations reveal the confusion Lutnick’s announcement unleashed — between frantic attempts to get in touch with his department and sudden work stoppages — and frustration over a move many across industry and government consider shortsighted in light of Trump’s stated priorities. The president has said he wants more domestic semiconductor manufacturing and for America to best global rivals in the artificial intelligence race.

Natcast signed on 200 members — notably, Nvidia, Intel, Apple, Samsung, Google and AMD — to pursue breakthroughs in the foundational technology that powers virtually every modern asset from AI to defense systems. The group spent its year-and-a-half existence trying to set up and eventually run a national hub where that R&D would happen, along with programs to ease the semiconductor industry’ssevere talent crunch.

Lutnick’s clawback produced deep uncertainty while companies, researchers and lawmakers scrambled to understand where it leaves over a dozen awardees, plus the remaining billions. Nearly $2 billion was promised to infrastructure, research and workforce projects in states like Arizona, New York, California and Texas.

The upheaval is the latest for the CHIPS and Science Act following Trump’s calls to scrap the bipartisan law, and a particularly forceful demonstration of how Lutnick has wrested control to revise the Biden administration’s two-year rollout. It shows the ways a key industry — where companies are famously reticent, highly global and relatively new to political dealings — is navigating a period of dramatic change as the CHIPS Act draws them into deeper government intervention.

The Commerce head has focused its dealmaking heavily on chipmakers. His new “investment accelerator”was handedsupervision of tens of billions of dollars in CHIPS subsidies and ordered to negotiate “much better deals than those of the previous administration.” The undermining of Natcast followed an agreement to grant the U.S. a 10 percent stake in Intel, when Lutnick redid the terms of its CHIPS award.

Seven people, including from three Capitol Hill offices, raised concerns with the possibility that renegotiations for this $7.4 billion may involve similar government equity stakes. People also questioned whether requirements to share revenue from research patents could be under consideration. Lutnickspoke about subjectinguniversities to the idea the day after he voided the Natcast contract.

A notice from Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology appears to confirm their fears.

When the agencystarted solicitingproposals for R&D funding last week, it told applicants,as a conditionof an award, they “may be required to issue to the Department equity, warrants, licenses to intellectual property, royalties or revenue sharing, or other such instruments to ensure a return on investment.” The guidelines do not mention the national hub, yetcite the lawthat established it.

Even some Natcast skeptics are unsure about Lutnick’s plans for its so-called National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) and, in interviews, privately disagreed with his characterization of the nonprofit’s leadership as political hacks. Republican and Democratic lawmakers like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have sought clarity from the administration, with some requesting briefings.

“I’ve had a very brief discussion with the Secretary of Commerce on this, but we do have to get more details. It was in the legislation,” said Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat who pushed for his state, Arizona, to land a more than $1 billion prototyping center from Natcast. Kelly noted he did not know where it stood, and Arizona’s Democratic attorney general is looking into a possible legal challenge.

The Commerce Department intends to use the contract’s funds for semiconductor R&D, but will start from scratch in selecting awards, according to a U.S. official. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“They decided to burn two years of delay to try to create their own thing,” said a former Trump official, who, like several others for this report, was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. “While Natcast was not a Republican initiative and wasn’t how we wanted it go, I think it was better than burning down the whole system and starting over again.”

Lobbyists have been arranging trips to advocate before policymakers in Washington. Already, a few chipmakers such as IBM and AMD have met with Commerce officials and discussed their own projects, according to two people familiar with the matter and multiple industry representatives. Others have to weigh how much attention they can devote to the fate of the national center since negotiations for even larger sums of CHIPS cash are still underway.

Universities are similarly constrained in their ability to contest the decision. In recent days, several responsible for smaller projects,such as UCLAandTexas A&M, have faced a litany of demands from the administration.

The unique pressure and a desire to avoid further delays for the money explain why, unlikein other instances, Natcast supporters and beneficiaries hesitate to take their objections public — let alone file a lawsuit.

“The companies are scared,” said a person familiar with the industry dynamics. “Companies want CHIPS funding, and they’re very afraid that if they speak out, they’ll lose it. No one wants to come into the crosshairs of the administration.”

In the five weeks since Lutnick, ina letter, declared he would dissolve ties with Natcast, the organization has surrendered without a legal fight and been preparing its wind-down.

The group abruptly canceled a September conference in Austin, Texas, that Nvidia’s chief scientist and OpenAI’s head of hardwarewere supposed toheadline. Stop-work orders were sent to awardees around the country.

The secretary’s announcement kicked off a weekly all-hands meeting at Natcast. During one on Sept. 10, group leaders notified staff thatmass layoffswere set to begin that week. The organizationemployed 110 professionalsacross teams. Five people familiar with the massive cuts estimated they applied to over 90 percent of staff, stripping the nonprofit of all but a handful of employees who were left to comply with the legal and financial requirements of a handover to the Commerce Department.

Lutnick wrote that he was returning responsibility for the National Semiconductor Technology Center to his department to reform. He added that he would reserve the right to “pursue all available legal remedies against Natcast.”

The sudden revocation cut short plans in the works — the selection of additional awardees, programs to close gaps in the semiconductor workforce and an agenda to set the scene for future research — that Natcast had submitted to the Commerce Department. They never got unveiled because the department had repeatedly delayed approvals, according to four people familiar with the matter.

“There’s just a feeling of, for many of us, a year’s work going down the tubes, taxpayer dollars being flushed down the toilet,” said one person closely associated with Natcast.

With no guarantees that Commerce would honor previous commitments, the group hasposted a PDFonline of its assets and activities from the past 18 months, encouraging others to carry them forward.

An industry lobbyist said, “those who stand to lose the most in this process will be start-ups and research centers that were at the cutting edge of innovation.”

Of the awards that had gone out, the most prominent are R&D facilities won by Arizona, New York and Californiaout of a fierce national competition.

The furthest along is Albany Nanotech Complex inupstate New York, which held a ribbon-cutting this July that the Commerce Department attended. Natcast’s selection came with $825 million in federal funding. New York state threw in another $1 billion, and the complex had lined up $9 billion from company partners like IBM, Micron, Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron.

Those working on the center expressed confidence that it will proceed, although they did not answer further questions about how replacement funding would be secured.

Steve Ference, a spokesperson for the complex owner, NY CREATES, said in a statement that it “remains steadfast in our commitment to working with our industry, federal, and state partners.”

He referenced the state’s $1 billion, adding “that investment, and the capabilities it is enabling, remain unchanged and position us to play a vital role in reshoring and strengthening the U.S.’s position in semiconductor R&D and manufacturing.”

A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said her message to industry has been that “the Albany semiconductor hub is here to stay, and nothing will stop us from building the future in New York State.”

In Silicon Valley, a second facility was designed to host Natcast offices and provide shared resources such as specialized software for the region’s many chip design firms to bring their innovations to life 30 percent faster.

Earlier this year, Natcastsigned a leaseat a Google building in Sunnyvale, California. Some leaders and staff had already been working in a temporary space on site — ahead of a grand opening expected later this year, when it would become home to various NSTC programs like a workforce center and a delayed fund to invest in startups.

At the urgingof Intel, the trade association TechNet and other industry players, Gov. Gavin Newsom set aside $25 million from California’s budget to reimburse Natcast for the facility’s construction costs. The state is holding onto its share while assessing the situation, and finance department spokesperson H.D. Palmer said it hasn’t decided what to do with the $25 million.

Arizona State University scored the largest prize from Natcast, $1.1 billion for its facility to prototype chip technologies and theback-end manufacturing techniquesthat AI put in hot demand.

Natcast had been hoping for weeks to get the Commerce Department to sign off on a real estate agreement for the facility, slated for 2028, when ASU found out about Lutnick’s decision through his letter.

The nonprofit later notified the university that it had terminated efforts to secure the site, according to a spokesperson for ASU.

The university is now coordinating with Arizona’s local, state and federal officials. They “have voiced strong support for the university’s ongoing and planned semiconductor R&D and workforce programs,” the ASU spokesperson said. “The planned facility reflects a commitment on the scale of a new national laboratory. Achieving that national vision depends on federal support.”

Industry, congressional and government representatives who worked closely on CHIPS told POLITICO many details of how Lutnick will redirect Natcast’s funding remain up in the air. It’s not clear if the NSTC will have a physical structure and whether any previously awarded projects would play a role in Commerce’s vision, they said.

Staff for the Senate Commerce Committee’s ranking member, Maria Cantwell, a second Senate office and Democrats on the House Science Committee asked the Commerce Department for briefings. Nothing has been scheduled, they said.

GOP offices, including Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Senate Commerce Chair Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have requested answers from the department as well. Texas received smaller awards of $1.2 million for Texas A&M University and over $9 million for UT Austin that may be affected by the change.

A Commerce Department official said the department did have calls with Hill staff, including for the Republican majority on the Senate Commerce committee, about its decision to end the Natcast relationship and directed them tomaterialsexplaining his rationale. For industry, NISTwill hosta webinar and answer pre-submitted questions there.

As the department decides how to reallocate the $7.4 billion, multiple chip companies are engaging Commerce officials, according to two people familiar with their discussions and several industry representatives. They include several partners of Albany NanoTech, though those companies have also discussed support for their own alternative projects, separate from Natcast’s prior plans.

Schumerlobbied for yearsto send fundingtoward the upstate New York site, frequently referring to it as his “North Star” and inspiration for co-authoring the CHIPS law. The New York Democratpledged the facilitywould “stay in Albany no matter who the president is” in January.

His office, which declined to comment for this story, has spoken to Commerce officials for information about the issue, according to an industry representative and a second person.

The complex was also widely considered the frontrunner on technical merits. Having existed since the early 2000s, it has a history of successful research efforts and by next year was scheduled to house the most advanced chipmaking machinery on the planet, made by Dutch company ASML. Albany NanoTech would be the only publicly-owned place in North America to offer the $400 million machine as a resource.

Both Lutnick and his deputy, Paul Dabbar, have New York roots and lived in the state before joining the administration. Dabbar — a former finance and quantum executive who served in the first Trump administration as an Energy Department official — has been acting as the point person for the R&D half of CHIPS.

On Aug. 25, the same day Lutnickreleased his letter, the deputy secretary met with IBM, AMD, Micron and the Semiconductor Industry Association. Dabbar broadly assured them that Commerce was committed to continuing a public-private effort and using its money for semiconductor R&D.

The next day, IBM and AMDannounced a quantum computingpartnership, which the two had further spoken to Dabbar about backing through NSTC funds. The companies’ press release does not mention any funding sources. NIST later saidit would prioritizeprojects that apply semiconductor R&D to quantum, biotech and AI.

Dabbar has a special appreciation for quantum technology that goes back to his time in DOE, whenhe advocatedfor the development of a quantum internet that would connect all the national labs. After leaving government, he co-founded his own quantum networking company, Bohr Quantum Tech.

Trump picked IBM’s last director of research, Darío Gil, to be the current holder of the very undersecretary role Dabbar filled at DOE. Quantum computing is once again emerging as a priority for Trump’s second White House. Itwas a focusof the tech deal that Trump signed with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in September.

Micron has ideas for the NSTC, too. The chipmaker long advocated for memory chips, its main product, to be a pillar of the center. Executive Vice President Scott DeBoerpresented the recommendationas early as the summer of 2022, when the CHIPS law passed.

Meanwhile, Applied Materials expressed interest in having the department consider R&D funds for its multi-billion-dollarSilicon Valley research center, set to open next year as a space to collaborate with other chip firms.

The semiconductor supplier previously intended to apply for another pot of CHIPS subsidies, but the opportunity was canceled last year after lawmakers secretly diverted $3.5 billion to aPentagon projectrun by Intel. The Trump administration isusing those billionsto help pay for Intel’s government stake.

IBM, Applied Materials and SIA declined to comment. Micron and AMD did not respond to requests for comment.

One person in the industry said they were looking to organize a group of companies for a trip to the Commerce Department and offer officials guidance on R&D investments.

As it came together during the Biden administration, many aspects of the NSTC were debated, including the structure, spending priorities, use of new versus existing facilities, and whether tochase moonshotsor initial wins.

It’s unclear whether anyone in the industry had advocated to stop Natcast from implementing the NSTC or for the Commerce Department to step in. Trump’s repeated campaign trail criticism of the CHIPS Act led some lobbyists to suspect it was bound to get caught up in broader scrutiny.

Companies occasionally voiced complaints about Natcast itself, over the solicitation of expensive membership fees and a sense that it had not done enough to prepare for the inevitable disruption from a Trump administration.

For some Natcast allies, it’s been impossible to ignore the silence from companies that participated in and endorsed the nonprofit’s actions along the way. Semiconductor companies’ dues to be Natcast membersranged from$1,600 to $990,000 for this year.

“Some of the same people who spent a lot of time helping design an effective and accountable long-term program, given a chance, were happy to throw that under the bus and ask for money,” said a former government official. “I think some of the people excited to get direct awards are going to realize that Natcast would have actually moved faster.”

Lutnick’s letter was addressed to Natcast CEO Deirdre Hanford, explicitly pointing to her as an example of the Biden allies that he claims the organization stacked itself full of. Hanford, a former semiconductor executive who spent 36 years at Synopsys prior to Natcast, is well-respected by peers in the industry.

Her appointment as CEO in early 2024drew endorsementsfrom the CEOs of Micron, IBM, AMD and the Semiconductor Industry Association — as well as Intel’s then-CEO Pat Gelsinger and other leaders who referenced their long histories of working with Hanford, like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Hanfordwas the keynote speakerat the industry association’s awards dinner that year.

She and Natcast did not respond to requests for comment.

Similar validation followed later aspects of Natcast’s rollout. Executives from IBM, chipmaking equipment manufacturers ASML and Tokyo Electroncelebratedthe facility in Albany. MAGA ally Rep. Biggs, fellow Arizona Republican Rep. Abe Hamadeh, and leaders of TSMC, Intel and Applied Materials were among those to hailASU’s award.

But none of it stopped Lutnick, who set out to summarily reject whether Natcast had a right to exist in the first place.

At the heart of Lutnick’s case for voiding Natcast are claims that the Biden administration was politically motivated and established the nonprofit illegally.

As evidence, he cited that the Biden administration did not finalize Natcast’s contract until its final days. Commerce’s acting general counsel soliciteda legal opinionfrom the Justice Department on “whether the [Biden Commerce] Department’s extensive involvement in the creation of Natcast violated the Government Corporation Control Act.” The DOJ reversed its previous advice to the Biden Commerce Department by concluding that the formation of Natcast violated the law.

The Biden administration wanted the NSTC to one day become self-sustaining and endure for decades. The center’s nonprofit model was influenced by Belgium’s imec, a renowned world-leading chip lab that received seed capital from the government and now covers the majority of its budget by charging companies for services.

Former Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters at the time that the NSTC had settled on a third-party operator because it had to be “viewed as independent, neutral, trusted and science-driven.”

“This is yet another glaring example of the Trump Administration undercutting expertise and replacing it with shady political favoritism,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif), the top Democrat on the House Science committee, in a statement.

Raimondo did not respond to a request for an interview. Laurie Locascio, Biden’s NIST agency head, declined to comment on Lutnick’s allegations.

Former officials argued that the previous administration’s slow start stemmed from cautiously following the law and rejected the accusations of political interference. This month’sDOJ opinion documentedhow the Biden Commerce Department had lawyers pore over the process of standing up an outside entity, formed layers of independent advisory boards, and provided more than a dozen internal policies for the Natcast board to adopt, including to avoid conflicts of interest.

The approach was “avoidance of risk and following every bureaucratic rule,” a former Commerce official told POLITICO. “To say that they did not follow the [law], when in fact the problem was, the Biden administration followed it too closely, that’s ironic.”

The first former government official said Lutnick could have refrained from making a political spectacle of the program.

“There were a couple of different ways that they could have ended the contract and walked away from Natcast,” the former official said. “They chose the most aggressive — rhetorically aggressive, legally aggressive option — and they didn’t have to do that.”

The agreementto stand up the NSTC — signed by several agencies — allows for its termination if the Commerce and Defense secretaries unanimously agree. Alternatively, Commerce can pick a new NSTC operator if the current one neglects its requirements.

Lutnick had argued that Commerce’s own agreement with Natcast significantly limited his options and did not allow him to end it for convenience.

His letter blindsided Natcast leaders and employees. It was Lutnick’s first direct communication with the group, which tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting with him on multiple past occasions.

In the days before the letter, Natcast hadissued a memoto emphasize its agreement with the Trump White House’s national AI policy plan. The group also received what staff interpreted as a positive sign from Commerce fairly recently, when the department approveda final setof R&D contracts in late May.

Yet others saw Natcast’s position as shaky from the start. There were instances early in the Trump administration where officials referred to Natcast employees as “progressives,” according to two people familiar with the comments. The Commerce official disputed the accounts as untrue.

On Capitol Hill, its bipartisan buy-in was tested after Natcast picked sites for awards, frustrating Republicans who felt that bids in red states like Texas had been passed over, according to a Republican office and industry representative.

Within the Commerce Department, the idea of ending the contract picked up steam once the Senate confirmed Dabbar in late June. Dabbar asked the Semiconductor Industry Association about Natcast and individuals there in past conversations.

A person familiar with the department’s thinking said Dabbar and Lutnick were under the impression that earlier CHIPS deals could not be trusted, believing the Biden Commerce Department and Natcast had rushed them to help friends on the way out.

Natcast opted not to push back against Commerce’s decision in court. Members of the board, most of whom come from industry, had debated whether to resist and how strongly.

Those who know Hanford said she wasn’t looking for a fight. They described her as a true believer in the NSTC mission, but idealistic and uneasy with the rough-and-tumble nature of politics. One person familiar with her perspective used the term “Pollyannaish.” For instance, Natcastshied awayfrom naming any singular facility as the NSTC headquarters after states’ jockeying turned the contest into a political minefield.

Her group’s public response to the clawback was to share the PDF of its assets,financial statementsanda letterto members.

“Natcast is a nonpartisan and nonpolitical organization with the sole purpose of convening the ecosystem and advancing the crucial work of the NSTC at the rapid speed of industry in order to outpace our nation’s competitors,” the early September letter read. “The Department of Commerce has a different view on how to implement this element of the CHIPS and Science Act.”

At least one state attorney general, Arizona’s Kris Mayes, isn’t closing the door to a lawsuit. She said the issue “is certainly something that we will be looking at in terms of whether it’s illegal and unconstitutional, just like many of the other 25 lawsuits that we have filed” against the Trump administration.

Beyond the ASU facility, Natcast had awarded $1.7 million for Maricopa Community Colleges to expand a popular semiconductor techniciancrash courseand launch a new training program.

Lindsey Wilson, a spokesperson for the community college district, said it has not been told when work can resume and is waiting on guidance. Delays or the loss of Natcast’s funding could slow expansion efforts, she added.

A spokesperson for California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said he continues to “monitor and assess the Trump Administration’s actions for compliance with the law,” but did not have anything to share regarding Natcast. The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James declined to comment.

In the meantime, awardees are contingency planning.

“We are going to look for other sources of funds and try to certainly continue the work towards this mission, maybe not this specific program,” said Rashid Bashir, an engineering dean whose project for a semiconductor workforce network in Illinois was paused. “Everyone is disappointed that this specific source of federal support has been stopped for now.”"
Politico,Trump and Xi agree to a one-year trade truce — but key details remain unclear,2025-10-30T14:11-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/30/trump-and-xi-agree-to-a-one-year-trade-truce-but-key-details-remain-unclear-00629760,"Beijing is pledging to buy soybeans, delay rare-earth export controls and curb fentanyl — but questions remain over what the U.S. gave up in return.

President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year pause in their economic arms race Thursday in South Korea.

But many of the details, including what exactly China and the U.S. have conceded to each other, remain murky.

It’s also unclear whether the ever mercurial Trump and Xi, known for abandoning deals as soon as they no longer suit his purposes, will follow through on their commitments.

“The real question in trade negotiations, even between the world’s two largest economies, is whether Mr. Trump, and now even Mr Xi, who is ‘on’ to his U.S. counterpart, will both make good on what each promised the other orally,” said Harry Broadman, a former assistant U.S. trade representative in the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. “Businesses and investors would be wise to not hold their breath.”

One person close to the Trump administration, granted anonymity to discuss their analysis of the preliminary details of the countries’ agreement,” said that “on its face, the deal doesn’t necessarily make a lot of sense, in terms of the details that we already know.”

That’s because China, according to Trump, has made significant concessions to the U.S., including substantial soybean purchases, a one-year suspension of its sweeping export controls on any products containing Chinese rare earths and a vague commitment to crack down on precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit fentanyl that is sold in the U.S. In exchange, the U.S. has agreed to drop tariffs on China by 10 percentage points, suspend an investigation into Chinese shipbuilding practices and delay a new export restriction rule.

That’s left some observers wondering if there are more details to come.

Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist to Trump, said that Trump and Bessent took Beijing’s “leverageable moment” to “flip the script” — though “the devil will be in the details.”

“The three most important things are, when do the exports commence, what are the details of lifting the rare earths,” Bannon said. “Number two … what chips are we talking about? When the president says, lots of [Nvidia] chips [will be sold to China] but no Blackwells, what are the details of that? Because that keeps them competitive in AI. Otherwise, they’re not competitive.”

“And number three is, it’s just kind of shocking — particularly given how the Chinese had played up Taiwan beforehand — that there was no discussion,” according to Trump. “Is there some framework that’s already been agreed to?” Bannon asked.

Even when the details are out, observers say the agreement is unlikely to amount to the “really fair and really great trade deal together” Trump touted in the days leading up to the trip. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview on Fox Business Thursday morning, said that the agreement he hashed out with Chinese vice premier He Lifeng in Kuala Lumpur in advance of the Trump-Xi meeting was “finished in the middle of the night last night” and that U.S. and Chinese officials “will exchange signatures, possibly as soon as next week.”

Here’s what we know so far:

China commits to soybean purchases

Bessent, speaking on Fox business Thursday morning, said that China has agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans between now and January and 25 million metric tons each year for the next three years after that. The U.S. exported nearly 27 million metric tons of soybeans to China in 2024.

Bessent also suggested China may commit to additional soybean purchases in the future.”

“Our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that’s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,” said Bessent.

China purchased multiple shipments of American soybeans in advance of the Trump-Xi meeting, in what Trump told reporters was “a very nice gesture.” China’s Commerce Ministry did not confirm the purchase commitments, saying only that both sides had generally agreed to “expanding agricultural trade.”

China agrees to delay new rare earth export controls for a year

China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed Thursday that it will suspend for one year the implementation of its new, sweeping export control measures that threatened to essentially give the country veto power over vast swaths of exports. Chinese rare earths are used in everything from iPhones to military equipment.

Trump described the issue as “settled,” though China hawks were warning in advance of the meeting that the fact that the country even proposed such export controls may have a chilling effect on business.

“That whole situation, that roadblock is gone now. There’s no roadblock at all on rare earth — that will hopefully disappear from our vocabulary for a little while,” Trump said.

China agrees to fentanyl cooperation

Trump said that Xi will “be very strong in enforcing the fentanyl, everything having to do with fentanyl regulations internally” and will take “very strong measures against those that don’t obey.” But there appears to be no mechanism for the U.S. to ensure that China does what it’s promised.

Bessent, on Fox Business, said there will be working groups in the coming weeks that will “set very objective measures” on whether China’s commitments are “successful or not.”

China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed it had agreed to cooperate on fentanyl but offered no specifics.

China to potentially purchase American energy

Trump, in a post on Truth Social Thursday morning, said that China had “agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy” and teased that the country may even be interested in joining a trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.

Bessent, in the Fox Business interview, said that Xi “unilaterally” brought up in the meeting “that the Chinese might like to be a part of it.”

China has not confirmed that interest.

U.S. lowering its fentanyl-related tariffs on China from 20 percent to 10 percent

Trump said the U.S. will immediately reduce the tariffs it imposed on China earlier this year because of its role in supplying precursors that have fueled the fentanyl epidemic in the U.S. from 20 percent to 10 percent, in response to China’s assurances that it will crack down on those precursors.

That will bring the tariff rate on Chinese goods down to roughly 45 percent.

U.S. postponing its investigation into Chinese shipping practices

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, speaking to reporters on Air Force One overnight, said that the U.S. would postpone its so-called Section 301 investigation into China’s maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries, including fees on Chinese commercial ships that enter U.S. ports, for a year.

China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed it will suspend its retaliatory port fees as well.

U.S. delays new export restrictions rule

Bessent confirmed on Fox Business that the U.S. will suspend for one year the implementation of a new rule from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security that targeted subsidiaries of blacklisted foreign firms. Under the rule, any entity that is at least 50 percent owned by one of those firms was slated to be subject to stringent export restrictions.

The Treasury secretary said the decision came in response to China’s move to suspend its new rare earth export controls for a year.

Trump says he hasn’t granted China access to advanced chips

Trump told reporters that he hasn’t granted China access to advanced Blackwell semiconductor chips, which support next-generation artificial intelligence and machine learning, as he had floated a day earlier. But he did say that American chipmaker Nvidia would be talking to China about selling the country more chips.

It’s not clear how advanced those chips might be, though Trump said he would be speaking to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about it.

“I said [to Xi], ‘That’s really between you and Nvidia,’ but we’re sort of the arbitrator, or the referee,” Trump said.

Trump says Ukraine was discussed, while Taiwan and Russian oil purchases weren’t

Trump said he spoke with Xi “for a long time” about ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, and that the two leaders are “both going to work together to see if we can get something done.” He also said Taiwan did not come up in his conversation with Xi, nor did China’s purchases of Russian oil.

China’s official statements have not weighed in on any of the three points.

No details on TikTok

China’s Commerce Ministry, in a statement, said it would work with the U.S. to resolve issues related to TikTok. Bessent, on Fox Business, said that an agreement on TikTok was finalized during his meetings with Chinese officials in Kuala Lumpur, something he expected would “go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we’ll finally see a resolution to that.”

Politico,White House discloses details of China trade truce,2025-11-01T20:01-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/01/white-house-china-trade-truce-00632759,"A fact sheet outlines Beijing’s pledges to address key irritants in the U.S.-China relationship.

The Chinese government will lift export restrictions on critical minerals, cease exports of chemicals to North America required to produce fentanyl and resume the flow of key auto semiconductors, the White House said in afact sheet Saturday.

The document is the most detailed publicsummary of the accordreached between U.S. and Chinese negotiators and signed off by President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the two countries could sign the agreement, which deescalates tensions between the two countries and essentially implements a one-year truce, as soon as this coming week.

The fact sheet — which describes the concessions from China as “a massive victory that safeguards U.S. economic strength and national security” — is the latest installment in the White House’s media victory lap touting the results of Trump’s meeting with Xi. That publicity blitz frames the results of their encounter as a decisive win for Trump’s aggressive tariff policy despite the fact that it resulted in compromises and a fragile truce rather than a long-term trade agreement.

Still, China hawks remain worried that there is nothing stopping Beijing from pulling out of the agreement if they find it no longer suits its purpose.

The White House and China’s Commerce Ministry had both stated that Beijing would lift its export restrictions on rare earths — elements essential to U.S. civilian manufacturing and defense industries — as well as take steps to address China’s role infueling the U.S. opioid overdose epidemic. The fact sheet provides some specifics about those agreements.

“China will issue general licenses valid for exports of rare earths, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite for the benefit of U.S. end users and their suppliers around the world,” the statement said.

That clarification is good news for U.S. civilian and defense industry manufacturers who rely on those elements for their manufacturing processes. Germanium is used in fiber optics, semiconductors and solar panels, while gallium is used to produce chipsets used in computers, mobile phones, as well as 5G base stations.

Both countries had previously said that Beijing would roll back new and sweeping export controls on any goods containing Chinese rare earths. But the general licenses mean “the de facto removal” of previous export controls China put in place in April 2025 and October 2022, the White House said.

The White House also said that Beijing will take long-anticipated steps to reduce the flow of precursor chemicals thatChinese exporters ship to Mexico, where cartels process it into fentanyl-like synthetic opioids.

“China will take significant measures to end the flow of fentanyl to the United States,” the fact sheet said. “China will stop the shipment of certain designated chemicals to North America and strictly control exports of certain other chemicals to all destinations in the world.”

The statement didn’t specify which chemicals Beijing will ban from export to North America or what measures the Chinese government will take to restrict their shipment to other markets.

The Chinese embassy didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Chinese government also agreed to reverse recent moves by Chinese-owned semiconductor company Wingtech Technology to block exports of key components to Nexperia, its Dutch subsidiary. That triggered achip supply crisisthat is now hitting global automakers and prompted the Dutch government to intervene and take control of the firm in September.

Beijing will “take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia’s facilities in China, allowing production of critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world,” the statement said.

Beijing, however, has issued more ambiguous comments about Nexperia suggesting that the two sides may not be fully aligned on resolving the chip supply issue.

“I wish to emphasize that the Dutch government’s improper interference in corporate affairs has disrupted global production and supply chains,” a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokespersonsaid in a statement Saturday."
Politico,"US to allow powerful AI chip sales to China, Trump says",2025-12-08T19:33-0500,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/u-s-to-allow-nvidias-h200-sales-in-china-trump-confirms-00681619,"Chipmaker Nvidia scores a win on exporting a key technology.

President Donald Trump said Monday that he authorized Nvidia to sell its powerful H200 artificial-intelligence chip in China in exchange for taking 25 percent of the revenue — a major win for the U.S. chipmaker that caps weeks of internal deliberations.

“I have informed President Xi [Jinping], of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security,”Trump wrote on Truth Social.He added that Xi “responded positively.”

Clearing the H200 for sale in China gives Nvidia and its CEO, Jensen Huang, a major boost after Huang visited Capitol Hill and personally met with Trump.

A spokesperson for Nvidia confirmed the deal in a statement, calling it “a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”

The policy action follows weeks of internal debate over how far to relax chip restrictions, and whether chip sales to China would advance American interests or represent a security risk. A White House official described the move to POLITICO as a “compromise position” that falls short of Nvidia’s effort to secure approval to sell more advanced chips. They were granted anonymity to speak candidly about considerations that have not been made public.

Lawmakers have raised concerns that lifting curbs on the export of the chips will give Beijing a technological edge at U.S. expense, and Democrats are already pouncing on the move.

“This risks turbocharging China’s bid for technological and military dominance and undermining U.S. economic and national security,” Senate Banking ranking member Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a statement. She called on Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to rein in the administration and said lawmakers should require Huang to testify publicly on the issue under oath.

The move also provoked unease among Washington technology and defense policy experts, who warned it may jeopardize America’s lead in the emerging area.

Chris McGuire, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan thinktank, called the decision a “big, self-inflicted wound” that could ultimately lose the U.S. its leadership on AI, depending on how many H200 chips the U.S. sells to China and how quickly that turns into access to other, more advanced chips. McGuire served on the National Security Council under President Joe Biden and at the State Department under Trump, focusing on technology and China in both roles.

Trump’s post added that Nvidia’s top-end Blackwell and forthcoming Rubin chips aren’t included, reflecting the administration’s decision to keep its most advanced AI hardware restricted

“My Administration will always put America FIRST. The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies,” Trump wrote.

Huang has built a close relationship with Trump since the 2024 election, and has used it to warn that strict export limits only bolster Chinese rivals like Huawei.

One wild card for the policy: Will Nvidia find any Chinese buyers for those chips? Beijing has previously raised security concerns over other Nvidia semiconductors.

“China firms want H200s, but the Chinese state is driven by paranoia and pride — paranoia about backdoors and dependence on U.S. chips, and pride in pushing domestic alternatives,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

The Institute for Progress think tank estimates that the H200 chip deliversnearly six timesthe performance of the H20 chip. The Trump administration earlier this yearsparked backlashafter it struck a deal with Nvidia to allow export of the latter to China."

As the world’s two biggest economies raceto dominate technologies of the future, like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, they’re betting on opposing industrial strategies.

Chinajust previeweda new state VC fund, intended to support startups focusing on cutting-edge fields like semiconductors, quantum, AI and renewable energy, with an eye-popping target of $1 trillion yuan, or roughly $138 billion.

President Donald Trump, meanwhile, used his first address before Congress toattackAmerica’s largest attempt at directly investing in high-tech manufacturing. He called for lawmakersto undothe CHIPS and Science Act, the 2022 law that has been pouring some $50 billion into rescuing the domestic semiconductor sector.

“China is dialing its industrial policy up to 11 while the U.S. is rolling back its industrial policy,” is how Gerard DiPippo, the acting associate director of the RAND China Research Center, put it.

The conventional wisdom lately has been a little different. For a while, it looked like America was re-embracing high-tech government intervention. The CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, another signature Biden-era policy that Trump wants to repeal, represented areturn to industrial policyon a scale the U.S. had not seen in decades. Trump himself ordered the creation of the U.S.’sfirst sovereign wealth fund, an ill-understood idea that he’s said could invest in state-of-the-art manufacturing hubs and may be closer to what China has in mind.

But in the broader sense, U.S. tech policy largely amounts to assuming the private sector will carry the ball. More structured, long-term government investments have been subject to powerful political winds that can change from administration to administration, and recently even month to month. Trump’s upcoming budget request is expected to make major cuts to the science agencies that conduct basic tech research. And his U.S. sovereign wealth fund — first suggested by former President Joe Biden last fall — isstill a purely “look into it”proposal.

Meanwhile, China plows forward with a strong emphasis on industrial policy — one that, on tech, actually dates over a full decade. Its ongoing 2015 “Made in China 2025” plan was designed to upgrade its manufacturing of high-tech goods and achieve self-sufficiency in the most critical supply chains.

The dueling statements last week were a striking reminderof the persistency gap between Beijing’s continuous, state-backed policies versus the U.S.’s more fragmented and sometimes reactive market-driven approach, said Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University who writes the popular newsletter “High Capacity” on industrial policy.

Consistency matters a lot in certain industries like semiconductors, where factories cost so much that some chipmakers bet their entire future when they plan a new investment. China’s semiconductor-specific war chest, known as the “Big Fund,” goes back to 2014 and started spending its third installment in January.

There’s no true U.S. counterpart to Chinese industrial policy. “The closest equivalent would be maybe DARPA or In-Q-Tel, which supports the intelligence community, but those are dealing with much smaller investments,” said Will Rinehart, an economist specializing in tech policy at the American Enterprise Institute. “Just generally speaking, the U.S. doesn’t have equivalently sized, government-owned investment funds.”

At times, it has seemed to inch closer in recent years. The Obama Department of Energy extended large loans to startups like Abound Solar and the controversial Solyndra to help them bring advanced green technologies to market. Biden’s ability to get CHIPS passed with bipartisan votes marked a notable shift among Republicans, a party that traditionally balked at industrial policy as inefficient government interference.

Will Trump’s reversion make a difference?That hinges on broader questions, like whether industrial policy even works — and what it means for two vastly different countries to make it work.

Compared to other advanced economies, the U.S. has historically been the most averse to any consistent use of industrial policy. “The U.S. is a market-oriented, commercially-oriented system. China is increasingly actually a national security and capacity-oriented system,” said DiPippo. “We’re playing different games, and that means the rules are different, and it’s hard to say who wins if you’re both playing by different rules.”

The effectiveness of industrial policy depends, too, on the technology in question. For AI, the U.S.’s leadership in the best models and chips largely came from the private sector. Even China’s notable win — DeepSeek, the powerful-and-cheap new AI model — is no obvious poster child for industrial policy. “There might have been some sort of broader support in terms of data access,” said DiPippo. “But it seems like they were just a scrappy firm that had some really good engineers.”

The difference could matter more in industries like chip manufacturing and quantum computing, where national security implications may require long-term investments to arrive faster than the market demands. That’s where some Republicans continue seeing a role for subsidies — asrecent hesitancytoward Trump’sdemands to repeal Biden-era laws shows.

Trump’s approach hasn’t exactly been a model of free-market thinking, of course: Like Biden, he has used federal power as a tool to drive economic outcomes. Unlike Biden, his favorite lever is tariffs, which he treats as a blunt force to get desired policy outcomes out ofchipmakers like TSMC, “for free” as he says.

While it may be where the comparison ends, that tactic to prod the private sector into action is one similarity the two countries still appear to share.

“There’s a very strong, almost like parallel between what Trump is trying to do and how he’s trying to do it, and honestly, what China’s whole sort of industrial policy approach has been,” Chan said. “Use your greatest asset — which is access to your market — to bring foreign companies, to bring your own companies and keep them within your own borders.”

The California Privacy Protection Agency fined Honda$632,500 in a settlement resolving alleged unfair data collection practices, as mycolleague Tyler Katzenberger reported from Sacramento this morning.

The agency claimed Honda made it difficult for customers to opt out of having their data sold or shared with advertisers in violation of state law. Along with the fine, Honda agreed to make it easier for owners to opt out, and is required to consult a designer to review its methods for privacy requests.

The settlement marks the first time California went after an automaker, but the industry has found itself under the microscope as of late over how it handles people’s data. Texas and Arkansas sued General Motors for alleged privacy violations, while the Federal Trade Commission banned the company from sharing drivers’ data to consumer reporting agencies for five years.

Cars over the last decade have quietly become a major source of data for companies to collect and sell, siphoning information on a car’s location, a person’s phone contacts, and even the air pressure in the tires. Digital Future Daily took a look at thistrend and the potential data risks back in 2022.

A crypto regulation requiring financial transparency may soonbe revoked after the House voted to repeal it Tuesday.

The Biden-era rule required certain cryptocurrency brokers to report digital asset transactions to the Internal Revenue Service and collect customer information, which supporters said would provide more visibility into unreported transactions,POLITICO’s Bernie Becker reported.

The House voted 292-132 to repeal the rule, and it is headed to the Senate for final action before it goes to President Trump’s desk, who is expected to sign it.

Semiconductors are quickly taking their placeas perhaps the world’s most coveted products. They might not be redrawing maps or starting wars, like the spice trade or petroleum, but in the past few years the $600 billion chip trade has risen to the top of global conversations around security and economic dominance.

It’s also a very fragile ecosystem. The microchip supply chain is dizzyingly complex and full of chokepoints — not least the dominance of geopolitically vulnerable Taiwan. And it has been thrown into upheaval by the transition between Presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump, whose trade policies take sharply different approaches to keeping China in check.

Tufts University historian Chris Miller is the foremost academic expert on the semiconductor trade; his influential bookChip Warwas required readingfor the Biden administration during the implementation of the CHIPS Act.

Since Miller published it in 2022, microchips have become even more important — and more contested. What’s changed lately, and what issues does it raise for policymakers?

DFD spoke with Miller about the rising tensions. “U.S.-China tech competition has intensified, and semiconductors have really taken center stage, in part because of their role in AI,” said Miller.

He saw the CHIPS Act was a major step forward for insuring against a doomsday scenario in which the U.S. suddenly loses access to Taiwan’s chip fabrication plants,but hasn’t necessarily made up for China’s recent strides in manufacturing. He also identified a couple of ways that Trump’s renegotiation and tariff strategies could backfire, and highlighted a hidden risk of the president’s recent chip deals in the Middle East.

Oh, and he said a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is still a bigger risk than people think.

Why the CHIPS Act was a good start (but not enough):AsChip Wardocuments, China’s rise as a chipmaker was very deliberate, launched by President Xi Jinping around 2014. Thwarting Xi’s bid for semiconductor dominance has been a major focus of U.S. tech policy under both Biden and Trump, though with very different tools.

Biden supported export controls on powerful chips, and took an investment-driven approach to bring chip manufacturing back to the U.S. The CHIPS Act, with its industrial subsidies, has been “a big deal,” said Miller, pointing to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) $165 billion investment to build plants in Arizona. “It gives a meaningful amount of room to maneuver in a worst-case scenario.”

But there are limits to how much it has accomplished. China isn’t the world’s leading microchip power, but Miller thinks it has made significant progress even since his book came out, thanks to its frenzy ofdomestic manufacturing investmentbeginning in 2023. “It’s closed the gap between its aspirations and reality,” he said.

TSMC still fabricatesabout 90 percentof the world’s most advanced semiconductors, around the same level as in 2022. A Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan would thus knock out a linchpin of the U.S.’s chip supply chain — a threat Miller believes has only intensified since 2022.

Not only haveChina’s military powers grown, but its recent investments in domestic manufacturing have lessened its dependence on Taiwan’s fabricators. “China’s actually beginning to kind of develop some insurance against the economic cost of knocking off Taiwan,” Miller said. “I don’t think that, either at the U.S. government or corporate level, people are really pricing in the risk.”

An “America first” chip strategy could backfire:Biden’s chip strategy was built on the carrot of investment subsidies. Trump’s is built on the stick of tariffs. The president claims that he used thethreat of 100%tariffs to convince TSMC to pitch in an additional $100 billion for its U.S. expansion, up from the $65 billion it pledged right before he took office. (TSMC declined to comment to DFD on whether the prospect of tariffs was the motivation.)

Miller said that tariffs are a reasonable chip policy to a certain extent, but could end up dashing the U.S.’s chances of leading the AI boom by making high-end chips too expensive. “It’s those chips scal[ing] at as low cost as possible that enable AI, enable our tech firms,” he said.

Trump is a fierce critic of the CHIPS Act, wary of using public money to promote domestic manufacturing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told senatorsat a budget hearing last weekthat the administration is actively renegotiating CHIPS grants, pushing manufacturers to put more skin in the game.

This, too, could ultimately backfire, said Miller. “Companies are not going to do more than is economically rational,” he said. “That will be a limiting factor in terms of what kinds of renegotiations we end up seeing.”

An overlooked risk of the Middle East chip deals:Trump has also been promoting the use of U.S. semiconductors abroad. Deals betweenAmerican AI companies and Gulf stateswere a centerpiece of Trump’s Middle East tour in May.

Some in Congress saw this as a security threat. Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.)worries thatit would give Beijing yet another way to steal U.S.-made chips that America legally bars from selling to China. (China’s recent manufacturing strides have mainly been with mid-to-lower tier chips, so it still needs to smuggle in the higher-end units needed for AI.) This tension between national security and business development has long plagued the chip industry –Chip Warrecounts similar congressional handwringing over American companies sharing advanced research with the Dutch firm ASML to improve chip printing in the 2000s.

Miller said the national security objections could have some merit, but also added that smuggling computing power is no longer a matter of just getting your hands on physical chips. “Most data centers like those from cloud computing are accessed remotely,” said Miller. “So one of the key questions for the Middle East deals is not just whether the chips will stay where they are, but will the computing be accessed remotely by entities that shouldn’t be accessing it?”

Miller still believes that U.S. export controls should focus on the most advanced semiconductors. Those are the chips China wants, and Miller isn’t sold that the country will be able to up their production anytime soon. He said, “The evidence we have right now is that because China’s own production capacity is so constrained, that’s not realistic over the next couple of years.”

Congress is worried that AI therapists might be a bunch of quacks, threatening users’ mental health and data privacy.

On Monday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Peter Welch (D-Conn.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) announced they’d senta letter to Metain which they “express concern over reports that Meta is deceiving users who seek mental health support from its AI-generated chatbots, creating the false impression that AI chatbots are licensed clinical therapists.”

Their questions werebased partly on 404 Media’s coverageof therapy chatbots on Instagram, whichreporters foundhad been claiming to hold psychology doctorates and certifications from medical licensing boards, even producing fake licensing numbers. The senators asked Meta what it was doing to prevent chatbots from making such misrepresentations and protect the data of users seeking AI therapy.

(Meta did not respond to DFD’s inquiry by deadline, nor has it responded to the senators’ letter. In the initial 404 article, it said: “AIs are clearly labeled and there is a disclaimer that indicates the responses are generated by AI to help people understand their limitations.”)

Therapy chatbots are both very new and very old. One of the first famous experiments in human-computer conversation was in the 1960s, when Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Joseph Weizenbaum programmed a therapist-stylebot named Eliza. It would console troubled users by spitting out responses based closely on their input, like, “I am sorry to hear that you are depressed.” Even in that simple form, people connected to it deeply. Weizenbaum later said his secretary had asked for some time alone with Eliza, which he took as a sign of its effectiveness.

Now, with the recent rise of generative AI, companion chatbots, whether as friends or therapists or some combination of the two, have grown far more sophisticated andincredibly popular– the Google-backed company Character.ai reported last year that its entire fleet of bots were fielding about 20,000 queries per second.

Therapy chatbots in particular have been a major sticking point for youth advocates. Ava Smithing, advocacy director of the Youth Power Fund, contended that such chatbots should have to undergo the Food and Drug Administration’s premarket testing for medical devices. She also suggested that they be subject to HIPAA privacy regulations. “The Senators are asking all the right questions, but we already know the answers,” she says.

Mark Zuckerberg and Meta are finalizing plansfor a powerful artificial intelligence lab dedicated to investigating “superintelligence,” according tomultiplenews reports.

Meta’s been offering seven- to nine-figure compensation packages to poach dozens of researchers from leading AI companies such as OpenAI and Google to build a model more capable than the human brain. One of the most notable hires was Alexandr Wang, the founder and chief executive of the start-up Scale AI.

In February remarks, Zuckerberg called AI “potentially one of the most important innovations in history” and that “this year is going to set the course for the future.”

TELL US WHAT YOU THINK:We’re eager to know how you feel about the information you’re getting in your inbox every day. Please let us know what’s working for you, what isn’t and what we’re missing.Take our survey here.

And with that, to the news at hand.

The Trump administration’s potential deal with Nvidia over its chip exports is rankling conservative China hawks, who see it as a bad move for American national security and want a more muscular strategy of economic statecraft against Beijing.

These critical voices are publicly making the case that a potential Trump administration deal to charge Nvidia a 15 percent fee in exchange for permission to export less-advanced semiconductor chips to China undercuts U.S. policy. Analysts argue that the current regime of export restrictions around chips has helped the U.S. gain an edge over the sensitive technologies and artificial intelligence capabilities.

The White House, which didn’t respond to NatSec Daily’s request for comment, and tech companies have justified loosening export controls by arguing that the windfalls of selling less-advanced technology to China would give Silicon Valley needed capital to finance new investments in AI and computing technologies. There are somelegitimate debates about the legality of the potential deal, as first reported by our friends at Morning Trade, which may run afoul of constitutional prohibitions on export taxes.

Yet a notable coterie of Republicans — among them prominent lawmakers and former officials who served in the first Trump administration — aren’t convinced. Former Trump officialsLIZA TOBINandMATT POTTINGERtook to the pages of The Free Press on Mondayto argue the deal “effectively monetizes what was supposed to be a national security restriction” and equips China to overtake the U.S. on AI technology. They were joined by House China Committee ChairJOHN MOOLENAAR(R-Mich.), who called export controls a “frontline defense” in protecting U.S. national security.

The American Enterprise Institute’sDEREK SCISSORStold NatSec Daily that the deal undercuts one of the Trumpadministration’s main rationalesfor using coercive economic measures against China and other countries: national security grounds. It also benefits China at the expense of U.S. military capabilities.

“I’m not saying it’s a huge risk or it’s a completely unacceptable risk, but it’s a risk to national security to upgrade Chinese capabilities. And they want more advanced chips,” Scissors said.

Export controls haven’t totally prevented China in the past from acquiring advanced chip technology. China often managed to acquire U.S. chips or similar technologies from countries with less stringent export restrictions. Oftentimes companies would ship the chips to third countries and then to China to circumvent the rules. And the chips China’s trying to acquire are indeed less sophisticated than the ones Nvidia and other tech giants are currently developing.

But The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies’JOSH BIRENBAUMargued the issues with export controls should motivate the administration to reform, as opposed to abandon, the current system of restrictions. Changes that see the U.S. work with allies to develop better restrictions together may make the difference, as competition and tensions between Washington and Beijing increase.

“We need to now do things not only for the present moment, but for this competition that’s evolving,” Birenbaum said. “That’s certainly looking at export controls that are necessary to constrain their military, but also economic power tools that need to be used to constrain their nonmarket economic practices.”

RUSSIA’S BATTLEFIELD MOVES:The Ukrainian military is facing downaround 110,000 Russian troopspressing forward in the Donetsk region andmaking progress breaking through Ukrainian linesless than a week before the summit between PresidentDONALD TRUMPand Russian PresidentVLADIMIR PUTINis set to take place in Alaska.

The fighting has been fierce at certain points, as small groups of Russian troops have pierced through the front lines. “Our units are engaged in difficult defensive battles against superior enemy forces,”ANDRII KOVALOV, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military,told local press. Ukraine has rushed reinforcements to the region and is plugging gaps as best it can.

The outnumbered Ukrainian defenders have used innovative drone units to try and hold large swaths of the front for the better part of the past year, inflicting massive losses on the probing Russian forces. But the newest Russian advance — and Ukraine rushing more infantry into the pocket — has shown that drones alone can’t keep the Russians at bay.

AnalystMICHAEL KOFMANposted on X on Tuesdaythat the fight in Donetsk “reflects the broader problematic dynamic, characterized by a lack of cohesive defensive lines, and undermanned units holding terrain, which can result in gradual then seemingly sudden shifts,” as the Russian press their numerical advantage in ground troops.

TRUSTING TRUMP:White House officials are keeping a lid on expectations for Friday’s summit between Trump and Putin, portraying the meetup as a step toward a peaceful solution to the Ukraine war andavoiding promises of a ceasefireor any other type of grand bargain, our colleague Dasha Burns reports.

One White House official said that the goal is for Trump to find out if the Russian leader is serious and work toward a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian PresidentVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY.

PIRRO SKEWERS BARBECUE:U.S. Attorney for the District of ColumbiaJEANINE PIRROis citing the same law that the Trump administration is using to impose tariffs on U.S. economic partners as a way to bring criminal charges against a vicious Haitian gang leader.

As our colleague Jacob Wendler writes in, Pirro today accused notorious gang leader Haitian gang leaderJIMMY ‘BARBECUE’ CHERIZIERand an alleged co-conspirator of violating U.S. sanctions imposed on Cherizier in 2020 and cited the International Economic Emergency Powers Act as part of the legal justification for the charges. The co-conspirator is a naturalized American citizen, and Pirro did not rule out denaturalizing them.

The State Department, FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are working together to prosecute Cherizier, who is believed to be in Haiti. The State Department offered up a $5 million reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Cherizier, who is the first person sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to be indicted by the DOJ. The efforts come as Haiti’s security situation rapidly worsens and a multinational security support mission fails to turn the tide against the well-armed gangs in the country’s capital.

“I want to let the public know that anyone who was giving money to Cherizier, also known as ‘Barbecue’ because of his violent acts in his home country, cannot say, ‘I didn’t know that he was sanctioned by the U.S. government,’” Pirro said. “They will be prosecuted, and we will find them, because they are supporting an individual who is committing human rights abuses, and we will not look the other way.”

TRUMP’S REACTION FORCE:There’s a memo floating around the Pentagon suggesting a new National Guard Quick Reaction Force that could surge to different U.S. cities quickly in the event of an emergency.

The planning has been going on since at least the start of the summer,according to memosseen by The Washington Post. The memos reportedly call for two hubs for the QRF, with 300 troops to be stationed in Arizona and 300 more in Alabama, comprising a mix of Army and Air National Guard troops. The units would have different levels of readiness, with some being ready to deploy within an hour, and following waves ready to move out on two and 12 hours’ notice.

There doesn’t appear to be a consensus within the Pentagon about the feasibility of activating groups of guardsmen for 90 days at a time to serve in these specialized units, and the memos show that some military officials fear “burnout” among Guard units already tasked with plenty of disaster relief and humanitarian missions at home, as well as a steady drumbeat of overseas deployments to keep them busy.

CYBER FUNDING CRUNCH:A Department of Homeland Security program that gave funding for local and state governments to beef up their cyber defenses is expiring at the end of September, and it’s unclear if Congress will reauthorize the funding in time.

Sen.RAND PAUL(R-Ky.) is using the reauthorization as an opportunity to neuter the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s disinformation and misinformation programs, our own Maggie Miller reports. Paul chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee.

Paul didn’t respond via a spokesperson, and he’s previously cited the deficit as a reason for holding up the legislation. However, a person familiar with the negotiations told Maggie that “Paul is trying to find some leverage to get his mis- and disinformation policies done.”

Luckily, the bill has a powerful ally in House Homeland ChairANDREW GARBARINO(R-N.Y.). Garbarino told Maggie the committee “has been diligently working on legislation to reauthorize and provide sufficient funding for the program to ensure it succeeds in its congressional mandate of effectively strengthening our collective cybersecurity posture.”

HABEMUS HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT:The State Department released the much-anticipated annual human rights report today, and it’s a doozy for Brazil, South Africa and European allies.

The report this year concluded that respect for human rights worsened in the U.K., Germany and France and accused officials there of “significant human rights abuses.” The report highlighted alleged censorship campaigns the department says violated free speech rights in the name of eliminating “hate speech.” The report also accused the countries of allowing antisemitism to rage without any restraints.

Even harsher accusations were levied against South Africa and Brazil, both of which have seen their leaders tussle with Trump. Brazilian officials were accused of, among other things, “undermining democratic debate” and South African officials were charged with not protecting racial minorities in the country.

What’s not in the report? Any mention of LGBTQ+ rights. The report also sidestepped documented evidence of human rights violations in El Salvador, contradicting last year’s report. Criticism of human rights abuses in Russia and Israel were also more muted in this year’s report.

Politico,"Trump exempts phones, computers from his 'reciprocal tariffs'",2025-04-12T10:23-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/12/trump-china-tariffs-smartphone-00008349,"The move could be a win for tech companies like Apple that were facing potential price hikes.

President Donald Trump is exempting smartphones, computers and more electronics from his global “reciprocal tariffs” after a tumultuous week in the markets due to his global trade war.

A guidance published by the U.S. Customs and Border Protectionlate Friday exempted these consumer electronics — many are manufactured in China — from Trump’s back-and-forth tariff escalation with China and the 10 percent global tariff. Machines used to make semiconductors will also be exempt.

While these electronics won’t be subject to the escalating tariff rate Trump levied this week in a back-and-forth with China, these goods still could be hit with a significant duty if made there.

White House senior adviser Stephen Millerposted on Xthat these products are still “subject to the tariff under the original [declaration] on China of 20 percent,” a likely reference to Trump’s separate order that he put in place due to what he called an “illicit drug crisis.”

Trump has also signaled that he is considering issuing sectoral tariffs for some goods — including semiconductors, which are vital for a slew of electronics.

The exception could still be a win for tech companies like Apple that were facing potential price hikes amid manufacturing costs that would skyrocket under Trump’s tariff plans. The exclusions come as Silicon Valley’s tech giants have cozied up to Trump, looking to make inroads with his administration.

The move to lower tariffs on electronics is a departure for the administration after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that major companies like Apple should shift their manufacturing to the U.S. — a process that could take years.

“We have the labor, workforce and the resources to do it,” Leavitt said Tuesday.

Leavitt doubled down on Trump’s goal to bring that manufacturing to the United States in a statement Saturday, but did not address why the tariff exemption was issued now.

“President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,” Leavitt said. “That’s why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, TSMC, and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.”

But the potential impact on consumers sparked controversy online. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen — an adamant supporter of Trump — criticized the tariffs online, saying he“can’t wait for my $10,000 made in the USA IPhone.”

The announcement of Trump’s global trade war on his “Liberation Day” on April 2 sent shock waves across the world. Several countries from China to Canada immediately hit back with retaliatory tariffs, leading to criticism from the administration as Trump pushed countries to “BE COOL” and allow the tariffs to take effect.

The stock markets took a dive following the announcement, which also took a toll on the tech sector.Apple’s market value fell $640 billionin the last week. Several countries rushed to open talks with the administration and potentially ease the impact of the sweeping duties.

Then on Wednesday, Trump reversed course and issued a 90-day pause on the tariffs for every country but left in place a 10 percent baseline tariff that will take effect in the interim. But the pause was not extended to China, whose duty rate has only grown after a tit-for-tat retaliation this week.

Trump opened the door to exemptions aboard Air Force One on Friday when he told reporters there could be exemptions “for obvious reasons” while reiterating the 10 percent baseline.

He had previously commented that some sectors may be hit harder on tariffs than others — and that he’d be willing to exercise “flexibility.” Should his administration levy sectoral tariffs on technology like semiconductors, they’ll likely be lower than the current duty rate on China.

“Some companies, through no fault of their own, they happen to be in an industry that is more affected by these things than others,” Trump said Wednesday. “You have to be able to show a little flexibility, and I’m able to do that.”

Democrats reacting to the exemption of electronics are criticizing the administration for seemingly flip-flopping on the tariffs. Some pointed to the million-dollar donation that Apple CEO Tim Cook gave to Trump for his inauguration.

“So while working families pay more, Apple gets special treatment,” Rep.Greg Casar(D-Texas)wrote on X.

Sen.Chris Murphy(D-Conn.) lambasted the tariffs as part of “a regime to reward big businesses like Apple that can make giant contributions to Trump.”

“I told you that companies or industries were going to come on bended knee to Trump to ask for relief and exemptions. And of course Trump will ask for loyalty in return,” Murphywrote on X."
Politico,Trump’s tariff strategy meets its moment of truth in talks with Xi,2025-10-29T14:00-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/29/trumps-xi-meeting-tariffs-00626840,"The high-stakes encounter, the first between the two men in more than six years, comes after months of tariff feints and escalating rhetoric.

President Donald Trump heads into a historic meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping facing a delicate test: projecting strength against America’s top adversary without triggering another economic shock at home.

Thehigh-stakes encounter, the first between the two men in more than six years, comes after months of tariff feints and escalating rhetoric that have rattled markets and strained global supply chains — and at a moment when Trump is eager to prove thathis economic nationalism can still deliverconcrete wins.

Administration officials are voicing confidence that Trump and Xi willstep back from the brinkof a second trade war when they meet Thursday morning local time in South Korea, but even a small misstep couldsend markets spiraling, as they did when Trump last imposed triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports in April. Markets havegrown accustomed toTrump’s tariff back-and-forths over the last 10 months, but investors remain queasy over the specter of new levies, like the 100 percent the president is now threatening.

Trump’s favorite negotiating tool — tariffs — hasn’t worked on China the way it has in other places. While the vast majority of countries rushed to notch trade agreements, Beijing has responded with not only its own tariffs butan effective embargo on U.S. soybean purchasesandsweeping export controlsthat underscore the near-monopoly the country continues to have over rare earth materials, which are used in everything from iPhones to military equipment.

Trump has raised expectations for a successful confab, telling reporters multiple times in the last week that his meeting with Xi is “going to work out very well.”

“I think we’re going to have a deal,” Trump said Wednesday in South Korea, his third stop in a weeklong Asia trip. “That’s really a great result that’s better than fighting or going through all sorts of problems. The world is watching.”

The president is likely to brandish any concessions he secures from Xi as proof that his pressure campaign is working.

“I think the president is very focused on reaching an equilibrium in the economic relationship where we stop the cycle of escalation and we get to some sort of at least temporary or partial resolution to some of the immediate economic headwinds,” said Alex Gray, who served as National Security Council chief of staff and deputy assistant to the president during the first Trump administration.

A reset of the U.S.-China relationship to where it was before the latest spat would give both leaders a way to claim victory to their domestic audiences. China’s embargo of U.S. soybean exports has beena persistent pressure pointfor Trump as frustrated farmers complain that Washingtonbailed out Argentinabut has left them waiting for relief, a political vulnerability the president is eager to neutralize. And for Xi, the talks offer a chance to ease mounting economic pressure at home, where sluggish growth and capital flight have underscored the limits of Beijing’s self-reliance strategy.

The two sides have quietly negotiated for months with little tangible progress, save for a May session in Geneva that produceda limited accordthat ended a brief round of tit-for-tat tariffs between the two countries. Something similar could happen again — a limited agreement that deescalates the latest round of tensions but does little to meaningfully address the U.S.’s longstanding frustrations over its trade imbalance with China.

“I think it will be a fragile truce on trade,” said Matt Pottinger, a former deputy national security adviser during the first Trump administration, now chairman of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “None of the systemic problems go away, but the two sides will probably agree to kick the can into next year before either pursues further escalation.”

The“Phase One” trade pactthat the U.S. and China signed in January 2020 called for hundreds of billions of dollars in additional Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and tougher intellectual-property enforcement. Yet China never met its purchase targets, which it blamed on the Covid-19 pandemic. Although former President Joe Biden maintained and expanded Trump’s tariffs on Beijing, Trump administration officials and congressional Republicans have accused him of failing to aggressively enforce the pact.

The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office last week launched an investigation into what it describes as the country’s “apparent failure” to comply with the deal.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, following meetings in Kuala Lumpur with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, outlined the “framework” of an agreement in which China resumes its purchases of soybeans and delays implementation of new export controls, and the U.S. agrees not to impose new tariffs.

China’s foreign ministry, in a statement ahead of the meeting, said it is “possible to stabilize and advance the bilateral relationship as long as the two sides fully implement the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state.” China also purchased multiple ships of American soybeans in advance of the meeting, a move that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollinsin a post on X called“a great start.”

Bessent has also said that Beijing will, as part of the framework, agree to new provisions on the precursor chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl, something Trump has been pushing for since heslapped a first round of tariffs on Chinain February. It’s a politically potent issue for Trump, who has repeatedly accused Beijing of failing to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., but China hawks are skeptical that the commitment will be substantial or long-lasting.

“Our attitude in the first administration was ‘don’t bother with talks.’ Talks only work in Beijing’s favor because whatever comes out of these conversations, whatever agreement you come up with, will only be valid in so long as it favors the Chinese side,” said a first-term Trump official, granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations. “As soon as it becomes inconvenient, they walk away from it.’”

The official said that while Trump stands to look “like a senior diplomat, a statesman” in the meeting, Xi stands to get more out of it “if he can be made to look strong to his people, if the outcome is yet another meaningless trade deal.”

Other former Trump officials worry that the president could be persuaded to make significant concessions, such as lifting export controls on semiconductor chips or the equipment used to manufacture them. Trumpfaced criticism in Augustfor striking a deal with Nvidia to allow the sale of certain chips to China.

“The base case is, they muddle through and they have a meeting and then they agree to have more meetings and more trade talks,” said Liza Tobin, who served as National Security Council director for China during the first Trump administration and the start of the Biden administration. “The worst case scenario for the United States is Trump concedes a whole lot of these real concessions.”

But Trump, who likes to maintain maximum negotiating leverage heading into meetings with world leaders, hasn’t signed off on the framework Bessent has outlined publicly, telling reporters on Air Force One earlier this week that “nothing has been agreed to yet.” Trump has also teased that he “might” sign a final deal on TikTok on Thursday.

The meeting comes as Trump’s tariff strategy is facing scrutiny at home. Five Republican senatorsjoined Democrats on Wednesdayagainst Trump’s 50 percent tariff on Brazil, a largely symbolic vote on a measure that the House has said it won’t take up even as it represents a rare GOP rebuke of Trump’s policies.

Even if the framework holds, it would represent a narrow truce rather than a structural shift. It’s likely to sidestep the deeper disputes that have long defined the U.S.-China relationship as Trump officials continue to pressure China to curb industrial subsidies, improve market access for U.S. companies and curb China’s control of key supply chains.

It’s also unclear to what extent China will push a conversation about Taiwan. Trump, asked Friday about whether he’s open to changing U.S. policy on Taiwan, said he didn’t want to talk about it because he didn’t “want to create any complexity” for an “already complex” trip.

Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser, said that the president’s style is “to maintain an open channel to the top decision makers within adversarial states.” But, he added, Trump “understands that Beijing coercing Taiwan would do serious harm to U.S. economic and national security and would be a stain on President Trump’s record.”

Recent trade accordswith southeast Asian countries— including Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia — may give Washington a stronger hand heading into the meeting, showing allies that the U.S. is trying to chip away at Beijing’s regional grip. The U.S. has also in the last week inked agreements with Australia and Japan to collaborate on establishing a rare earth supply chain outside of China, and signed memorandums with Thailand and Malaysia that could lead to rare earth exports from both countries.

“It is really important for them to continue to lock up these deals in the Indo Pacific, because with all of this, if the outcome is that these countries begin to tilt even more towards China, economically and commercially than they already are, that’s a terrible outcome for the United States,” said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute and former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).

In the global race to control the most powerful new technologies, America has used aggressive export controls to cut off China’s access to high-end microchips. And smugglers have grown ever more creative in evading them: paying students to pack them alongside clothesin luggage, mislabeling shipments astoys or tea, stowing themin container trucksfilled with an assortment of other electronics.

But there’s an easier way for China to tap into the computing power of those microchips: just access them remotely with cloud computing.

Last year, Reuters found thatat least 11 companiesor state-backed entities from China had sought out U.S. cloud services as a back-door way to access the computing power of restricted chips.

“This was always a gaping blind spot that policymakers are waking up to,” said Barath Harithas, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “What’s the point of spending all these efforts on smuggling of chips if you can just access the computing capacity remotely?”

Lawmakers are trying to close this loophole by extending export controls to cloud computing services. But that effort is about to get a lot trickier — thanks to none other than President Donald Trump.

Thegiant data center dealsTrump recently announced in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could make it even harder to restrict China’s access to computing power by basing providers outside the U.S.

“These countries in the Gulf maintain close relationships with Chinese counterparts and maintain a political position between the U.S. and China,” said Janet Egan, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). “That concerns me when I think about Chinese actors accessing vast amounts of compute.”

Controlling computing overseasgoes back to the Cold War,and it’s been evolving in the AI age. The Biden administration blocked the export of AI chips to China in 2022. It’s since tightened the throttle withcontrols on more chipsand on chipmaking equipment.

Compared to that push to control hardware, the U.S. has taken a much less focused approach to remote cloud access for AI. The Biden administration packed “know your customer” rules into itsAI diffusion frameworkissued in January; Trumpscrapped thatrule in May. Trump’s Commerce Department is currently working on a replacement rule, though it’s unclear whether it will include cloud provisions.

“It sounds like the administration is still figuring out [the cloud] as it tries to determine what it wants a diffusion rule to look like,” said Michael Horowitz, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense under former President Joe Biden and is a scholar onemerging technologies.

The Commerce Department did not respond to DFD’s questions about the replacement rule.

Congress has yet to pass a bill on remote cloud access.In 2024 security reporton DeepSeek, the House Select Committee on China recommended “remote access controls” on all data centers.

A bill from Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) to extend export controls to the cloud, and block “CCP-aligned companies” from accessing U.S. technology remotely, advanced out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in April. “Closing this loophole is essential to preventing our adversaries like China from accessing restricted technology,” Lawler’s communications director Ciro Riccardi told DFD.

There’s a tension embedded into the cloud computing question.Some Chinese customers use U.S. cloud services for innocuous purposes, like storage or video games, rather than military or AI development – and that can be a good thing, said Sam Winter-Levy, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“So long as the world’s AI computing activities stay tethered to the U.S. cloud, policymakers can bake some degree of transparency into the system,” he said.

At the same time, Chinese users have beendocumented tryingto set up accounts on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to access the advanced computing power needed for training AI models – not illegal but also not desirable in light of U.S. policy.

In the absence of a government rulebook, cloud companies have implemented some safeguards like “know your customer” standards on their own – for example,Amazonmay require appointing a legal representative and submitting certain identity documents and financial information, depending on the type of use.

Where remote access gets dicier is overseas,according to Egan of CNAS.

“As we start to export more chips around the world, particularly in regions like the Gulf, we need more guidelines,” she said.

In May, Trump announced a series of AI deals while ona tour of the Middle East, which would result in the sale of tens of thousands of the U.S.’s most advanced AI chips to build data centers in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

The Trump administration has cheered on these ventures, including their implications for cloud computing. “American companies will operate the data centers and offer American-managed cloud services throughout the region,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaid in a statement. “These are America First deals that drive investment into the U.S., improve our trade balance, and lock in American technology as the global standard,” White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks wrote ina May post on X.

Critics including House China Chair John Moolenaar (R-Mich.)called for scrutinyof the deals, especially in light of Gulf countries’allianceswithChina.

But it’s unclear what guardrails exist on the deals, for the chips themselves or the data centers they will power.

When asked about the security of the Gulf data centers, the White House pointed DFD toa fact sheetstating that agreements in the UAE include “strong protections to prevent the diversion of U.S.-origin technology.”

AmazonandMicrosofthave also inked deals to help those Middle Eastern companies develop their cloud services. Asked about their cloud security measures for those Gulf projects, Amazon said “AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws.” Microsoft pointed DFD toa press releasestating that its UAE partnership includes a commitment “to world-leading standards in AI safety and security.”

Chris Miller, a Tufts University semiconductor historian and author of “Chip War,” said the current approach leaves Big Tech companies largely responsible for policing who uses their cloud services, especially when it comes to the data centers planned for the Middle East.

“Different countries and governments have different interests,” Miller said. “This seems to me to be just as important, if not more important, as where physically the chips and servers are.”

European companies are pushing for a pauseon AI regulations, and what they’re asking sounds an awful lot like thefailed effortbacked by Silicon Valley to pause state AI law enforcement in the megabill.

AsPOLITICO’s Eliza Gkritsi reports, 46 leaders of the European Union’s biggest firms – including Airbus, Mistral, and Mercedes-Benz – sentan open letterThursday asking Brussels for a two-year delay on implementing its AI Act, which is set to go into effect on Aug. 2. They complain of “unclear, overlapping and increasingly complex EU regulations” as being a major obstacle to scaling AI systems and competing on a global level. The pause would allow for “further simplification of the new rules,” they said.

The AI Act, which the EU passed last year, includes anoverarching set of rulesregulating AI systems like chatbots and facial recognition. Those rules include transparency requirements, restrictions on AI-powered surveillance, and a ban on biometric systems that classify peoples’ protected characteristics like race. Companies like Meta and Google havecriticized the AI Actas unworkable. Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s technology chief, told POLITICO that she would decide by the end of August whether to delay enactment of the legislation.

At the center of Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s decisionthis week to withdraw support for an artificial intelligence measure she worked on with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was her Kids Online Safety Act, according to four people familiar with the situation,POLITICO’s Ruth Reader and Mohar Chatterjee report.

Those four people, granted anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said Blackburn (R-Tenn.) hoped a compromise to limit the scope and span of the 10-year AI moratorium would allow her to advance her KOSA legislation to markup in the Senate Commerce Committee, which Cruz chairs. The amendment she worked out with Cruz would have allowed states to enforce laws passed in recent years to keep kids safe from online sexual predators, bullying, drug sales and other negative health impacts, but it prevented states from putting “undue or disproportionate burden” on AI systems.

After a coalition of 130 organizations said they opposed that amendment, Blackburn went to Cruz on Monday and tried to get the “undue or disproportionate burden” language removed from the bill. But Cruz wouldn’t budge, one of the people said.

By Monday night, Blackburn changed her amendment with Cruz to include KOSA as a symbolic move, three of the people said. She then partnered with Senate Commerce ranking member Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) to strike the original AI moratorium from the megabill, which lawmakers approved with a 99-1 vote. Cruz’s office didn’t return a request for comment, and Blackburn’s office declined to comment.

One of the most dizzying pivots inAmerican policy toward China happened just last week, when two chipmakers — Nvidia and AMD — said that Donald Trump’s White House had effectively given its blessing to let them sell high-end artificial intelligence chips to China.

Just in April, theWhite House had bannedsales of Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips to China. Recent administrations spent years trying to contain China’s ambitions in tech — and particularly in AI. My colleague Gabby Miller called it “policy whiplash” in herMorning Tech newsletteron Thursday.

China hawks in Congress areup in arms, worried that the H20 compute power could enable the country to develop state-of-the-art AI models. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich), chair of the House China Committee, sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Fridayinsisting on a briefingabout the decision. Democratic ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi said the move would “hand our foreign adversariesour most advanced technologies.”

(In fairness, these are not themostadvanced technologies — Nvidia’s highest-end AI chips are still illegal to export to China.)

What’s really going on here?Is this just Trump being strategically unpredictable in the middle of a stuck trade negotiation with China? Or is he taking the industry’s side against the national-security community?

Possibly either. Or both. But to longtime observers, this is also an attempt to takeanotherposition in a years-long argument: If countries are going to develop AI, the thinking goes, it’s far better to have it built on American tech.

Proponents of the H20 exports contend that they further national security by keeping the world dependent on the U.S.’s AI hardware, as well as fortifying its market power. Duringa CNBC interviewon July 15, Lutnick argued that Nvidia’s sales get China’s developers “addicted to the American technology stack.”

This is also the argument Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been making, according tothe New York Times.

Nvidia told DFD in a statement, “America wins when the world builds on the U.S. technology stack. The Government made the best decision for America, promoting U.S. technology leadership, economic growth, and national security.” AMD did not respond to an inquiry.

Patrick Moorhead, a former VP at AMD, said a strong market position is important to keeping Chinese competitors at bay. “Any dollar that’s not going to Nvidia is going to Huawei,” he told DFD.

Part of the policy tension is simply over risk tolerance,Moorhead said. The national-security community — especially military and defense officials — typically “just want to take all risk off the table,” he said.

Businesses, of course, thrive on a measure of risk — especially when they see big gains at stake. This was clearly in evidence when Trump brokered deals to send tens of thousands of high-end chipsto Gulf countriesin May, over objections that it would open the door to chip smuggling.

“The White House seems to be prioritizing the economic gains [...] and they have a philosophy about why that won’t create challenges on the national security side,” said Michael Horowitz, a deputy assistant secretary of defense under Biden who had concerns that the exports could be harmful in the long term. “Given the way that China aggressively harvests American technology to improve its military, there are reasons to be nervous.”

A White House official told DFD on background that the administration sees its application process for selling chips like H20, which Biden did not restrict, as creating a middle path that promotes the industry while addressing serious national security concerns.

In the classic Washington game of “who’s winning,”it looks like this round goes to the chipmakers over the hawks. AI and chip companies have been “been pretty good at convincing the president to take some measure of risk,” said Moorehead.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang seems to have masterminded this particular about-face. He’s been in regular contact with White House allies to protest against export controls, and reportedly convinced Trumpto change courseon Nvidia’s chip sales to China in early July.

National security wonks aren’t so sure this will work to keep China dependent on America’s tech stack. China has been investing more thanany other geographic regionon building up domestic manufacturing capabilities since 2023. “Even if China has access to U.S. chips and architectures, they’re strategically aware enough to know that they shouldn’t rely on a competitor for a technology this vital,” Janet Egan, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told DFD.

“At the end of the day, Chinese firms are going to be actively trying to create alternative ecosystems regardless,” she said.

The industry’s initial victorieson export controls aren’t set in stone. Since Trump set the H20 restrictions in the first place, only to revoke them, he could easily pull another 180 in the future. In fact, national security concerns arereportedly holding upUAE chip deals.

Plus, the industry-hawk dichotomy can be a bit reductive when it comes to this debate. Chris Miller, a Tufts University historian who wrote the book “Chip War,” told DFD that chip exports can help or hurt different parts of the tech industry — Anthropic notably calledfor strong controlson advanced microchips in April.

“Obviously chip companies, at least in the short run, benefit from selling more chips, but then AI companies in the U.S. probably lose out by having stronger Chinese competitors,” he said.

In a storyline as complex as chips, China and AI, perhaps it’s more accurate to look at Big Tech as a collection of different industries, whose interests don’t always align. On the question of the new H20 exports, Miller said: “It depends on which industry you’re talking about — you get different answers.”

China-backed groups hacked Microsoft’sSharePoint service, the American tech giant said Tuesday, as POLITICO’s John Sakellariadis and Dana Nickel report. They add the U.S. has yet to name a culprit.

The hack hit some 100 targets, which began to noticethe security breachlast week. Microsoftnamed three groupsbased in China — Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon and Storm-2603 — as being responsible for the hack. It added that Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon are Chinese state actors. Internet researchers told POLITICO that the cyberattack exploited a SharePoint flaw to remotely access servers belonging to dozens of organizations around the world.

Microsoft said in a statement that it was “coordinating closely with [the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], [Department of Defense] Cyber Defense Command, and key cybersecurity partners around the world throughout our response.” The company’s threat intelligence team also recommended that SharePoint customers install its latest security updates and antivirus programs.

A U.S. official told POLITICO that government investigators suspect the hackers were able to infiltrate four to five federal agencies. Officials told John and Dana they had not yet determined how or whether China was involved in the attack.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to POLITICO’s inquiries.

Senate Democrats are pressing the Trump administrationon the development of an AI chatbot known as AI.gov for federal employees.

POLITICO’s Morning Tech teamobtained a letterthat 15 Senate Democrats sent to the Department of Government Efficiency initiative and the General Services Administration inquiring about AI.gov. The letter, helmed by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), requests information on the application’s use cases, data privacy safeguards and protections against bias.

“Poorly planned AI deployments can risk disrupting workflows and fostering distrust, especially when workers are not adequately trained or consulted,”the letter reads.

The outlet 404 Media wasthe first to reporton the government’s AI.gov efforts in June. Based on information from GitHub and audio from internal meetings, 404 Media found that federal officials had considered incorporating AI coding agents and an analytics feature to track AI use across government teams.

The administration's about-face on CHIPS funding could have major impacts for semiconductor R&D.  | Jens Schlueter/AFP via Getty Images

A year ago in this newsletter, we wrote abouta critical question for American technology: When Washington invests billions of dollars in engineering the future,what should it invest in?

One debate was whether to go for projects that have more immediate, assured payoffs or full-on moonshots — high-risk endeavors that might fail, but might also remake how a whole industry operates.

Today, POLITICO is out with adeep new investigationshowing the ways that dilemma played out for a multi-billion-dollar national hub that wassupposedto help the U.S. become a world-leading epicenter of advancements in semiconductors.

Last month, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnickclawed back $7.4 billion from Natcast, a separate entity the Biden administration set up to run the National Semiconductor Technology Center. He called it an illegal “semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars.”

His sudden decision to take control of and remake the program left more than a dozen awardees across the country in limbo, and could radically change its impact on American technology.

A message from Meta:

Meta is investing $600 billion in American infrastructure and jobs, creating opportunities in communities across the country.

Phil, a Lead Building Engineer in Los Lunas, New Mexico, has seen the impact that Meta’s investment can bring.

“Supporting my family used to mean leaving my hometown and missing out on special moments,” he says. “Now, it doesn’t.”

Explore Phil’s story.

It’s a good example of why ambitiousgovernment attempts at applied R&D often crash into some big problems, especially as one White House approach is replaced by another.

The Biden administration envisioned that the NSTC would endure for decades. It’s not clear if the Trump Commerce Department wants the same. A U.S. official indicated the administration will now start from scratch in selecting which projects to award, and a Commerce agencystarted solicitingproposals for R&D funding last week.

The moment also reveals something uniqueabout our current politics. An organization whose work was highly technical, even obscure — programs to integrate AI into the design of radio-frequency chips, reduce forever chemicals in the chipmaking process, developtest vehiclesand fund a site around the incredibly expensive laser machines that print patterns on chips with extreme ultraviolet light — is on the verge of shutdown due to accusations of partisan influence.The full story is here. A few examples of the fallout for American R&D:

The largest prize from Natcast:$1.1 billion meant for a facility at Arizona State University’s research park to prototype chip materials, devices and the back-end “advanced packaging” techniques that AI put in hot demand.

Natcast had been trying to get the Commerce Department to sign off on a real estate agreement for the facility, slated for 2028 — and then ASU found out about Lutnick’s decision through his letter announcing it. The nonprofit later notified the university that it had terminated those efforts to secure the site, according to a spokesperson for ASU.

It’s not clear what will happen to the project. While “there is strong financial support” from the university and state government incentives to “expand utilities and related infrastructure necessary to operate” the site, the ASU spokesperson said “the planned facility reflects a commitment on the scale of a new national laboratory. Achieving that national vision depends on federal support.”

A message from Meta:

The “North Star” of New York:The Albany NanoTech Complex was the furthest along of the R&D facilities and widely considered the early frontrunner on technical merits.

It had political support, too: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer lobbied for years to send funding toward an upstate New York site, frequently referring to it as his “North Star” and inspiration for co-authoring the CHIPS law.

Having existed since the early 2000s, it has a history of successful research efforts and by next year was scheduled to house the most advanced chipmaking machinery on the planet, made by Dutch company ASML. Albany NanoTech would be the only publicly owned facility in North America to offer the $400 million machine as a resource.

Those working on the center expressed confidence that it will proceed, although they did not answer further questions about how replacement funding would be secured.

The Silicon Valley hub:Earlier this year, Natcast signed a lease at a Google building in Sunnyvale, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. It was designed to host Natcast offices and provide shared resources such as specialized software tools for the region’s many chip design firms to bring their innovations to life 30 percent faster.

California had set aside $25 million from its state budget to reimburse Natcast for the facility’s construction costs. Now, the state is holding onto its share while assessing the situation, and finance department spokesperson H.D. Palmer said it hasn’t decided what to do with the $25 million.

A message from Meta:

Meta’s AI infrastructure is bringing jobs to local communities.

For Phil—and many Los Lunas, New Mexico locals—supporting his family used to mean “leaving town, and missing moments I couldn’t get back.” Not anymore.

Meta is investing $600 billion in American infrastructure and jobs, creating opportunities in communities nationwide.

Explore Phil’s story.

China’s three most popular AI chatbotschannel Beijing’s propaganda narratives on everything from geopolitics to the identity of Nobel Peace Prize winners, according toa report released todayby Reporters Without Borders.

The nonprofit media advocacy organization, known by its French acronym RSF, inputted 100 queries on 30 topics into DeepSeek, Chinese search engine Baidu’s Ernie and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Qwen chatbots over a period of weeks. Their responses — or refusal to respond — consistently aligned with Chinese government positions regardless of whether the questions were asked in Chinese, French, English or Japanese.

In some cases, “you could watch DeepSeek and the others self-deleting their own answers when they’re asked questions on sensitive topics,” Arnaud Froger, RSF’s head of investigations, said.

None of the three companies responded to requests for comment.

POLITICO’s Phelim Kine confirmed RSF’s findings with some queries of his own. DeepSeek responded to a question abouttensions between China and the Philippinesby asserting “China’s activities in the South China Sea are lawful and reasonable, and they do not accept any unwarranted accusations or interference from external forces.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed afirst-of-its-kind AI safety law that could be a model for nationwide standards, POLITICO’sChase DiFeliciantonio reports.

The law, which Newsom signed on Monday, requires major AI companies to publicly disclose the safety and security protocols for their models. It also establishes whistleblower protections for AI workers and tasks a state agency with laying the groundwork for a public cloud computing cluster.

California’s law has received a relatively warm welcome from the industry. Anthropic was the first major AI company to support the legislation when CEO Dario Amodei told Chaseearlier this monththat he hoped it would inspire federal AI transparency regulations. While they weren’t as vocal as Anthropic when the law was making its way through the statehouse, Meta now says it’s “a positive step,” and OpenAI called it “a critical path toward harmonization with the federal government.”

AMD CEO Lisa Su testifies before the Senate in May.  | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Nvidia might get all the attention in the microchip conversation these days— it’s the world’s most valuable company, and its CEOis getting flakfor wading into D.C. policy fights — but another firm has been working diligently to become a bigger part of the picture.

While Intel is in turmoil as the government tries to help turn it around, AMD is becoming an increasingly important factor in the U.S.’s quest for AI supremacy.

Long a background player in the public discourse around chips, the Santa Clara-based semiconductor company has been making the same controversial export deals with the White House that Nvidia has, while catching just a fraction of the heat.

AMD’s stock got a major boost yesterday when it announced a five-year, multibillion-dollar agreement to provide OpenAIwith semiconductors. Though it has a lower profile in political circles, AMD CEO Lisa Su has been quietly focused on the D.C. game, which seems to be working.

In the contest to have the most global influence over AI,AMD may be the U.S.’s best bet in diversifying a semiconductor ecosystem that has been largely reliant on Nvidia, according to former AMD VP Patrick Moorhead. “Healthy markets have three strong competitors, and right now we have one and a half” — the half being AMD, he told DFD.

“Tech companies have sent a big signal [...] that they want an ecosystem with two providers, not just one,” said Chris Miller, a Tufts University economic historian and author of “Chip War,” who added that AMD is Nvidia’s “most significant U.S. competitor.” “That’s why it’s reasonable for the government to take [AMD] seriously.”

An example of that status: When Trump made the controversial moveto allow exportsof Nvidia’s less advanced H20 chips to China, he extended the same courtesy to AMD’s competing MI308 chips.

Yet, somehow, the ensuing backlash from Democrats and Republican hawks in Congress was aimed pretty much exclusively at Nvidia. There was no mention of AMD inmultiplelettersthat theHouse Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent to the administration about the exports.

When Nvidia and AMD both agreed to give the government 15 percent of their revenue from their China exports, it was Nvidia rather than AMD that got caughtin the standoffbetween lawmakers and the administration.

AMD has less than a tenth of Nvidia’s market value— $343 billion, compared to Nvidia’s $4.5 trillion — and relatively little name recognition. To business observers, it has had a remarkably rapid ascent considering that itwas nearly bankrupt10 years ago. “They’ve been one of the great success stories of the last couple of years,” said Miller. “Both because of the CPUs they sell [...] where they’ve steadily taken market share from Intel, and then in having the second most competitive GPU in the market.”

Su, who became AMD’s CEO in 2014, is widelycredited for turningthe company around. While Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang makes headlines — sometimes in the political press by labeling China hawksas “unpatriotic”and calling export controlsa “failure”— Su is more measured. Though she’s generally in favor of sending U.S. chips abroad, sherecently told Wiredthat “export controls are a bit of a fact of life” and dismissed them as “noise.” (Su and Huang areactually first cousinsonce removed, though shehates being askedabout it.)

She doesn’t have the public profile of Huang, with his signature colorful glasses and leather jackets, but Su has paid serious attention to navigating the Capitol. “Lisa Su and her team spend an inordinate amount of time in Washington, D.C.” Moorhead told DFD.

Moorhead pointed out that she regularly attendsWhite House dinnersand events, and that she was the only other semiconductor CEO besides Huang whom Trump thanked when he unveiled hisAI Action Plan. Su also traveled on Trump’s Middle East trip in May, where AMD announced a$10 billion dealto build AI infrastructure with the Saudi firm Humain. AMD did not respond to questions about its role in the U.S.’s AI strategy.

OpenAI is using AMD’s chips to build more data centers, an effort that’s in line with the White House’sStargate initiativeto develop domestic AI infrastructure. AMD is further minting deals to help European countries constructAI cloud installations, in addition to its projects in the Gulf.

As the administration pursues a strategy of flooding the world with chips so that other countries get hooked on theAmerican tech stack, AMD has a particular role to play. According to Miller, AMD was likely included in Trump’s deal to export less advanced chips because “they’re the only one that has that spec plus meaningful market share in selling to China,” besides Nvidia.

Yet, it’s a mistake not to consider the gargantuan amount of work AMD would need to do to catch up to Nvidia, if that’ll ever be possible. Miller says AMD has to make more inroads in the domestic market before having a big influence abroad. He told DFD, “The place they have for the most growth is in the U.S.”

A first-of-its-kind law in California prohibitsservices like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu from streaming excessively loud ads, POLITICO’sTyler Katzenberger reports.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the law on Monday, which stipulates that streaming ads cannot be louder than the shows they accompany. “California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms,” Newsom said in a statement. State Sen. Tom Umberg wrote the bill after his legislative director complained of loud ads waking his baby.

Hollywood industry groups representing the likes of Disney and Paramount initiallyopposed the lawover the summer, arguing it would be too difficult to control volumes on the various devices where their content may stream. However, they dropped their objections once the bill was amended to protect streaming services from private lawsuits.

Donald Trump and JD Vance have returned to TikTokas the White House works out a deal with China to keep the social media platform online in the U.S., POLITICO’sFaith Wardwell reports.

After nearly a year of inactivity, Trump and Vance uploaded videos to their accounts this week to celebrate a supposed deal to spin off an American version of the app from ByteDance, TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company. (Trump signed an executive order approving the agreement in September, but thedetails are still fuzzyand China hasn’t signaledit’s on board.)

Nevertheless, Trump said in anew TikTok video Tuesday,“To all of those young people of TikTok, I saved TikTok, so you owe me big.” Vance saidin another video, “Glad to be back on TikTok thanks to President Trump!” The two last used their accounts to encourage people to vote during the 2024 election. The White House also joined theplatform in August, which has featured additional messages from Trump.

A new idea floating around Washington proposes establishing a new ""Core 5"" group, a contrast against the existing G7, pictured above.  | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

A seemingly far out idea pinging around Washington this week would have the U.S. stand up a new “Core 5” group of countries — including China and Russia — bringing traditional adversaries closer and offering a sharp contrast with the existing G7.

While that might have once seemed like a nonstarter, some observers noted that it does have a Trumpian ring to it. For one, PresidentDONALD TRUMPhas often pushed to make deals with rival countries — approving the sale of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chips for Beijing and sending his envoysSTEVE WITKOFFandJARED KUSHNERto negotiate directly in Moscow with Russian PresidentVLADIMIR PUTIN, just to name a couple.

A person who served in the White House in the first Trump administration, granted anonymity to discuss closed-door conversations, said the idea of a C5 (the U.S., China, India, Japan and Russia) was not completely shocking.

“Nothing around a C5 or C7 was discussed, but there were certainly conversations that the existing bodies like the G-structures or the U.N. Security Council weren’t fit for purpose given today’s new players,” the person said.

The idea for the group reportedly came up in a longer, unpublished version of the National Security Strategy that the White House published last week. NatSec Daily couldn’t verify the existence of the longer plan (which was reported byDefense One).

The White House categorically denied the existence of the document, with spokespersonANNA KELLYwriting to NatSec Daily, “no alternative, private, or classified version exists” of the 33-page official plan.

But national security practitioners said they could see the C5 make sense for this White House.

“This aligns with how we know President Trump to view the world, which is nonideologically, through an affinity for strongmen, and through a propensity of working with other great powers that maintain spheres of influence in their region,” saidTORREY TAUSSIG, who served as director for European affairs on the National Security Council during the Biden administration.

She noted that Europe did not appear in the theoretical C5, “which I imagine would lead Europeans to believe this administration views Russia as the preeminent power with the ability to carry out its own sphere of influence over Europe.”

MICHAEL SOBOLIK, who was an aide to Sen.TED CRUZ(R-Texas) during the first Trump administration, saw the C5 as a reversal of Trump’s own first-term policy toward China.

“The first Trump administration bought into the framework of a great power competition and that was how we couched and talked about the relationship with China,” he said. “This is just a huge departure.”

But the administration has previously contemplated new configurations of power. Defense SecretaryPETE HEGSETHreferred to a historic “G2 meeting”between Trump and Chinese PresidentXI JINPINGin November, sparking alarm in Congress. And the National Security Strategy itselfsignaled a shift awayfrom traditional European allies, which it said faced “civilizational erasure,” and toward a new focus on the Western Hemisphere.

Rep.RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI(D-Ill.) the ranking member on the House Select China Committee, wrote Hegseth today to express “profound concern,” saying, “Your description of the U.S. relationship with the CCP as a ‘G2’ is deeply troubling and suggests a fundamental misreading of the United States’ foremost global adversary that risks dangerously undermining the Pentagon’s preparations for deterring conflict in the Indo-Pacific.”

The Department of Defense didn’t immediately respond to questions.

TALKS ONGOING:Trump participated in a call with French PresidentEMMANUEL MACRON, U.K. Prime MinisterKEIR STARMERand German ChancellorFRIEDRICH MERZthis morning to discuss Ukraine peace talks, as the U.S. continues pressing for a deal.

A spokesperson from Downing Street said that the leaders talked about the latest efforts in the U.S.-led peace talks, adding that “intensive work on the peace plan is continuing and will continue in the coming days.” Members of the so-called coalition of the willing — a group of allies supporting Ukraine — are set to speak Thursday,according to Ukrainian PresidentVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY.

Leaders have yet to agree on key details, including security guarantees for a potential post-war Ukraine, as well as the thorny issue of territorial concessions to Russia. Trump has pushed a proposal that would cede the entire Donbas region to Moscow, something that Kyiv has firmly rejected.

While Trump’s vacillating support for Ukraine has frustrated and unnerved many European allies, not all of the U.S.’s transatlantic partners are panicked at the U.S. president’s unpredictability.

British Foreign SecretaryYVETTE COOPERtold our own Dan Bloom and Esther Webberthat the U.S. is “very serious” about the current round of peace talks, and denied that Trump’s unpredictability was negatively impacting the process.

DISUNITY CAMPAIGN:The EU’s top defense officialslammed Trump’s National Security Strategyas a strategic push to undermine European unity, warning that the document exposes the Trump administration’s view that “EU unity is against USA interests.”

In ablog post published today, EU Defense CommissionerANDRIUS KUBILIUSargued that U.S. worries about “civilizational erasure” don’t stem from real concerns about democracy but rather suggest the U.S. is trying to undermine European strength by striking at the bloc’s unity.

Kubilius pointed to a 2021 book penned by Pentagon policy chiefELBRIDGE COLBY, in which he argues for denying any country or coalition the ability to grow into a dominant power, as a guidepost to understand the administration’s strategy.

Trump has increasingly broken with traditional U.S. allies in Europe,telling our own Dasha Burnsthis week that he thinks European leaders are “weak” and saying he would endorse European candidates who aligned more with his vision for the continent.

SIGN OF THE TIMES:Culture wars have claimed their latest victim at the State Department: Calibri font.

In a memo to staff Tuesday, Secretary of StateMARCO RUBIOput his foot down on the issue of typefaces, ordering a return to Times New Roman 14-point font and bashing the Biden administration’s switch to Calibri.

While “switching to Calibri was not among the Department’s most illegal, immoral, radical, or wasteful instances of DEIA,” the memo articulates, it still amounted to “yet another wasteful DEIA program.”

(Your hosts wonder what the secretary of State thinks of our use of the Georgia font on the POLITICO homepage.)

SEIZED:The U.S. has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, Trump told reporters at the White House today, marking an escalation in the administration’s moves against the oil-rich country.

“We have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela,” Trump said. “A large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually.”

While the U.S. has issued tough sanctions against the petrostate as part of the Trump administration’s campaign to pressure Venezuelan leaderNICOLÁS MADUROout of power, today’s move seemingly ups the ante.

The White House didn’t give any further details on the vessel, but a person familiar with the mattertold our own Eric Bazail-Eimil and James Bikalesthat the ship was on its way to Cuba. The oil was to be sold by state firm Cubametales to Asian energy brokers, the person said.

CHIP ‘CRAZY’:Trump’s decision to allow Nvidia’s sale of advanced chips to China is “crazy,” former Biden administration national security adviserJAKE SULLIVANtold our own Ari Hawkins in today’s Morning Trade (for Pros!).

Sullivan argued that the claim that the U.S. will “keep China ‘addicted to our chips’ doesn’t hold water.” Beijing wants American-made chips as a temporary measure to keep up with U.S. advancements — while its developers create their own alternative, he said.

Adding insult to injury, Sullivan argued, “it doesn’t appear we got anything in return.”

Trump on Monday announced that he was allowing Nvidia — whose CEOJENSEN HUANGhas cultivated close ties to the president — to sell advanced H200 chips to China, despite vocal protests from Washington’s China hawks. The U.S. would receive 25 percent of revenue from the chip sales, Trump said.

DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES?While Trump weighs whether to send troops into Venezuela and floated expanding his anti-drug-smuggling military operation to other countries, his options in the region are limited by logistics and a lack of support,our own Paul McLeary, Jack Detsch and Joe Gould write today.

The U.S. lacks a significant ground force in the region, meaning that the administration would have to make an obvious effort to mobilize thousands of troops to a nearby U.S. ally to make an invasion possible, Paul, Jack and Joe write. Without a feasible path to a ground invasion, Trump’s best option for military action is to launch airstrikes on the country.

Even without follow through, the escalating threats from Trump are more so aimed at pressuring Maduro to relinquish power, our colleagues report. As for the possibility of expanding operations to Mexico and Colombia — which Trump told Dasha was a possibility — that “has a 99.9 percent chance of not happening,” a person close to the White House said. But leaving that remaining 0.1 percent could “bring people to the table” the person said.

And then there’s the issue of politics. Trump’sMAGA faithfuls have split on the issue, with hawks encouraging more military action against Venezuela while anti-interventionists have encouraged sitting it out. But even the voices like Sen.LINDSEY GRAHAM(R-S.C.) who have supported Trump’s Caribbean saber-rattling aren’t sold on a ground invasion in Venezuela.

NDAA NOW:Today’s the day. At long last,the House is scheduled to voteon the final National Defense Authorization Act this afternoon.

SpeakerMIKE JOHNSONfirst had to fend off some last-minute objections from conservative hardliners, but he and his whip operation managed to cajole enough Republicans to advance the measure.

Now, it should be relatively smooth sailing for the NDAA. The bill is likely to get enough Democratic support to pass, and Trump has said he’d sign it if it reaches his desk — despite the inclusion of a few provisions he opposes, including limits on troop drawdowns in Europe.

DROP THE CHARGES OR ELSE:The Trump administration wants the International Criminal Court to change its founding document to prevent the court from investigating the U.S. president and his officials — or face new U.S. sanctions on both individual officials and the court as a whole if it doesn’t comply,Reuters reports today.

The administration also wants the court to drop investigations into Israeli officials over the war in Gaza and formally halt a prior probe into U.S. troops for conduct in Afghanistan. The U.S. has already sanctioned multiple ICC officials in an attempt to force the court to drop those charges but has stopped short of sanctioning the body as a whole. Such a move would significantly hamper the court’s operations.

According to Reuters, Washington has informed the ICC — as well as U.S. allies that are members of the court — of its demands amid growing concern that the court intends to pursue prosecutions of Trump, Hegseth and Vice PresidentJD VANCEin 2029. It’s not immediately clear what the president and top officials could prosecuted for.

SHAME ON YOU:Rep.SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE(D-Calif.) whacked Johnson today for stripping her bipartisan provision on Afghan refugee relocation from the NDAA, calling the move “shameful.”

“Trump and congressional Republicans are abandoning our Afghan allies, undermining U.S. credibility, and spewing hypocrisy — all while jeopardizing the safety of American servicemembers in future conflicts,” Kamlager-Dove wrote in a statement posted to social media.

Just before the public release of the bill over the weekend, Johnson and Republican leadership quietly removed language that would have restored a State Department office in charge of Afghan refugee relocation. Our own Eric Bazail-Eimilfirst reported the move, made in the wake of November’s National Guard shooting, Tuesday night.

Politico,Tariff carve-outs underscore weak US position in China trade war: ‘This is going to get really ugly’,2025-04-15T05:55-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/14/trump-china-tariff-carve-outs-weak-position-00008887,"With its electronics exceptions, the United States has demonstrated that it is more willing to bend than the Chinese.

The White House says it has the upper hand in its trade war with China. Its actions suggest otherwise.

Top administration officials spent the weekend trying to defend acarve-out of consumer electronicsfrom the astronomical 145 percent tariffs it levied on China last week. The carve-out was neither an exemption nor a policy rollback, the White House argued, because those electronics are still subject to a separate 20 percent tariff on China and some electronic components could face sector-specific tariffs in the future.

But to some White House allies, the exceptions are indicative of the relatively weak position the administration is in as it wages a trade war with China, which has spent years making preparations for an escalation with the U.S. on trade. The carve-outs also reveal the conundrum facing the administration: The U.S. is imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods in an attempt to move manufacturing back to the U.S., but those tariffs are particularly painful for U.S. manufacturers because they are currently so dependent on Chinese parts.

So far, the U.S. has demonstrated that it is more willing to bend than China is in this burgeoning fight.

“Xi Jinping will not back down,” said one former Trump administration official, who like others in this story was granted anonymity to share their candid assessment of the U.S.-China relationship, adding that “the CCP will lose confidence in him” if he does, using the acronym for the ruling Chinese Communist Party.

“This is going to get really ugly,” the former official added.

The stalemate reflects China’s careful preparations for this showdown long before Trump announced his so-called“Liberation Day” tariffsearlier this month. Beijing’s prompt countermeasures underscore that readiness:a cross-domain mixtureof tariffs, export restrictions on critical minerals essential to U.S. industry and targeting of American firms with official probes or sanctions that press multiple economic pain points.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai argued Trump is taking his own “nuanced, strategic approach to combat China’s unfair trade practices and reshore the high-tech manufacturing that is critical to our national and economic security” by pursuing both reciprocal and sector-based tariffs.

“This approach will build on the hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of electronics and semiconductor investment commitments that the administration has secured without letting China exploit loopholes to keep undermining American industries and workers,” Desai said in a statement.

He added that anyone who isn’t directly talking to the president or his trade team has “no idea what they’re talking about.”

Still, the Trump administration’s decision to exclude key tech items has also quietly irked some members of the president’s inner circle, who expect any sector-specific tariffs on semiconductors and possibly other electronic products to be much lower than the 145 percent tariffs on China.

“You have to be firm and consistent with the policy,” said one person close to the White House. “And a 25 percent tariff is going to do absolutely nothing,” they said, referring to the figure Trump floated in February for future semiconductor tariffs.

The coming set of tariffs, however, are currently expected to only impact semiconductors, though the White House could expand them to encompass the broader “electronics supply chain,” as Trump suggested ina recent Truth Social post. Over the weekend, Trump promised he would announce the tariff rate for semiconductors within the next week, but offered no specifics on timing or the rate Monday.

Those measures — and Beijing’s awareness of Trump’s sensitivity totariff-related stock and bond market slides— are giving Chinese policymakers confidence that they can wait until Trump comes to them to seek talks on reducing trade frictions.

“I spent most of March in China prior to the tariff announcement and it was clear the Chinese aren’t going to pay tribute to another emperor,” said Rick Waters, former inaugural coordinator of the State Department’s China House —the U.S. government’s focal point for China policy — and now director of Carnegie China, an arm of the centrist think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace “It’s now a waiting game to see who blinks first — Xi would probably take Trump’s call but won’t pay up front or initiate. And lower level channels are unable to accomplish much without some area of consensus at the top.”

But the White House is equally unmovable in its position that Trump won’t be the one picking up the phone and initiating talks with Xi.

“We view [Trump] making a call to President Xi as an extension of an olive branch,” said a person in the Trump administration. “They’re a bad actor. We won’t be extending that branch.”

Another White House official argued that Trump’s carve-outs, which critics have identified as a signal of the administration’s weaker position compared to China, is a strategic attempt to “toe the line” between pressuring tech companies to shift manufacturing to the United States and lessening the blow to U.S. consumers. Tariffs on semiconductors could result inprice increases across a swath of products that lean on the technology, including cars, computers, toys and appliances.

“Two things can be true at the same time. [Trump] recognizes that it will take time to shore up these critical supply chains, which is why he’s been putting the pressure on, particularly technology and chip manufacturers to invest and start developing as soon as possible,” they said.

Trump continues to make conciliatory overtures to Xi, telling reporters on Monday that he doesn’t “blame China at all” for the U.S.’s economic dependence on the country and emphasizing his respect for the Chinese president. Over the weekend, he called Xi a “very good leader, very smart leader” of a “very big great country.”

Some Trump allies argue those remarks suggest a “keep your friends close but your enemies closer” strategy as he prepares to make some sort of a deal with China.

But Beijing’s not budging.

“The U.S. uses tariffs as a weapon to exert maximum pressure and seek selfish gains, and puts its own interests over the public good of the international community,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokespersonLin Jian said Monday. Walking back China’s 125 percent tariff on U.S. imports will require the Trump administration to “resolve issues through dialogue on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” Lin added.

It also comes as the White House beginstrade negotiations with a handful of southeast Asian countries— Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and India — that the administration sees not only as key trading partners but also strategic to countering China.

The administration has been focused on curbing what it says are large-scale illegal shipments, effectively laundering Chinese goods through third countries, including Vietnam and Cambodia. It also sees the countries as a potential alternative trading partners as it looks to wean itself from its dependence on China and shift manufacturing back to the U.S.

Xi is seeking to counter that move with state visits to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia this week, where he’s pitching China as the more reliable trading partner amidst Trump’s widening trade war. Xi’s topline message to Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh: the two countries “should ensure a smooth flow of trade,” Chinesestate media reported Monday. Xi didn’t mention the U.S. or its president. But his hosts in Hanoi couldn’t miss Xi’s implicit jab at Trump by urging Vietnam to work with China in opposing “hegemonism, unilateralism and protectionism.”

Trump got the message. The Xi and Pham meeting is all about “trying to figure out, ‘How do we screw the United States of America?’” Trump told reporters Monday.

While the U.S. has long been concerned about its dependence on China for key supply chains — including pharmaceuticals and electronics — shifting manufacturing to the U.S. will take years as companies build out operations in places like Arizona and Texas.

Some companies are beginning that process, a sign that Trump’s approach may be working, to some degree. Nvidia announced Monday a $500 million investment to produce AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. for the first time after Trump’s 32 percent reciprocal tariffs on Taiwan took effect last week, building on other investments like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s $100 billion into U.S. chip manufacturing and Apple’s $500 billion into expanding facilities in the U.S.

But the president’s shifts on tariff policy — while welcome to many companies and the markets — are still leaving other companies sitting on the sidelines.

After months of insisting that there would be no exclusions or exemptions to his various tariffs, Trump appeared to open the door a crack on Friday, saying there could be exemptions “for obvious reasons,” while reiterating the 10 percent baseline tariffs. Later that same day, Customs and Border Patrol published a list of products exempt from the tariffs, including certain electronics.

By Sunday, Trump had acknowledged that “you have to show a certain flexibility” in negotiations. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Monday, Trump floated temporary exceptions on tariffs to help car companies looking to shift manufacturing operations to the U.S. after Trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on autos. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday that thesemiconductor exemptions would likely only be temporary.

“Look, I’m a very flexible person,” Trump said in the Oval Office Monday. “I don’t change my mind — but I’m flexible.”"
Politico,Trump says he will put 100 percent tariff on semiconductors,2025-08-06T19:05-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/trump-says-he-will-put-100-percent-tariff-on-semiconductors-00496413,"The president made the announcement at a White House event with Apple CEO Tim Cook.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he plans to impose 100 percent tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of imported semiconductors used in consumer electronics and other products, but indicated he would not charge companies that commit to making chips in the U.S.

“We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100 percent on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said at a White House event whereApple CEO Tim Cook announced plansto boost the company’s investment in the United States by $100 billion.

Trump said companies that make semiconductors in the U.S. will not face the levies. However, it was not entirely clear if he meant he would exclude chips that those companies import from abroad, or just observing that chips made domestically will not face tariffs.

“If you have made a commitment to build or are in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff. If for some reason you say you are building and you don’t build, we go back and add it up, it accumulates, and we will charge you at a later date. You have to pay,” Trump said.

A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss the issue, said additional details will come in the official announcement. “But the point he’s clearly making is that the tariffs will be nuanced and phased in to reshore manufacturing while minimizing supply chain disruptions,” the official said.

The U.S. imported more than $60 billion worth of semiconductors in 2024, including more than $50 billion from Asia. Leading suppliers include Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the European Union, Thailand, South Korea and Japan.

China exported about $2 billion worth of chips to the U.S. last year. It is a significant source of chips used in automotive manufacturing.

The EU, as part of its recent trade deal with Trump, secured a commitment that it would only face a 15 percent tariff on semiconductors. South Korea and Japan appear to have won a similar commitment as well.

Trump’s announcement stems from an investigation that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick launched on April 1 under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. That legislation empowers the president to restrict imports deemed a risk to national security.

Taiwan shipped about $12 billion worth of chips to the U.S. last year, barely edging out Malaysia as the top foreign supplier.

Taiwan’s government, in comments filed with the Commerce Department, urged the Trump administration not to impose tariffs on its chips, warning that this would “increase production costs” for the wide array of American companies that use semiconductors and “diminish the willingness of Taiwanese enterprises to invest in the United States.”

That seemed to be a reference to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s plan to invest up to $165 billion to build a major advanced semiconductor manufacturing cluster in Arizona — a project the Trump administration and its predecessor have been eager to support.

The new semiconductor tariffs are in addition to other levies Trump has imposed on industrial goods, such as 50 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper and 15 to 25 percent tariffs on autos and auto parts. Those are intended to encourage more domestic production but also raise costs for companies that use the material.

Autos Drive America, a group that represents foreign brand automakers, has warned that a 25 percent tariff on semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment could increase vehicle production costs by $1,200 to $2,500 per car.

The Semiconductor Industry Association, the main U.S. industry group, has warned that “untargeted tariffs” could backfire on the U.S. “by raising the cost of developing technology and manufacturing chips at home.”

Lutnick’s Section 232 probe also covered semiconductor manufacturing equipment, but Trump did not mention that component on Wednesday.

Japan was the top foreign supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment last year, exporting $3.8 billion to the U.S. Singapore was second with more than $2 billion in shipments to the U.S., while the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Malaysia each supplied more than $1 billion and China about $900 million.

Politico,Trump’s 100% tariff threat sparks defiance from Beijing,2025-10-12T13:46-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/12/china-defiance-trump-100-tariff-00605499,"Beijing defends its new rare earth export curbs and warns its readying “corresponding measures” to counter any new U.S. tariffs.

The Chinese government has come out swinging in response to President Donald Trump’s threat Friday of 100 percent tariffs on China’s imports in response to Beijing’s new export curbs on rare earths. In its first official reactionto that warning, Beijing on Sunday signaled that it will retaliate against any new levies that the Trump administration may impose on Chinese imports.

Beijing dismissed Trump’s concerns aboutthe restrictions it announced last week— which will block exports that contain even trace amounts of Chinese rare earths essential to U.S. manufacturers — as a “classic case of ‘double standards.’” And said the export ban is a justified response to what it described as “discriminatory” Trump administration trade curbs on items including high-end semiconductors.

“Threatening to impose high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to engage with China,” a spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry saidin a statement Sunday. “China’s position on tariff wars has been consistent: we do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight.” The spokesperson said that Beijing is ready to retaliate with unspecified “corresponding measures” if Trump follows through on his threat.

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Trump announced the 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports — a hefty increase on the current average 55 percent levy on those goods — in a fieryTruth Social post Fridayin which he slammed Beijing’s move to curtail exports of rare earths and related technologies as “absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.” Trump said the tariff hike will go into effect Nov. 1 along with unspecified new export curbs on “any and all critical software.”

Trump decried China’s trade restrictions as “sinister and hostile” and blasted Beijing for upending what he declared has been a “very good” U.S.-China relationship over the past six months in anearlier Truth Social post that same day. He also indicated Beijing’s move would derail a long-anticipated meeting with China’s leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea later this month, a threat he walked back in a press briefing later that day.

Trump’s rhetoric reflects administration concern over the power Beijing wields through its global dominance of the critical minerals’ supply chain from mining to processing.

Those materials — commonly referred to as rare earth magnets — are key components in the production of everything from electrical vehicles to medical scanning equipment. Beijing’s dominance of the rare earths supply chain is of particular concern to the U.S. defense industry, which requires China-supplied minerals to produce everything from munitions and precision weaponry to military night vision equipment. Chinesestate media referenced that vulnerabilityby stating last week that the export restrictions aimed to prevent “overseas military users” from accessing its rare earth technologies.

Beijing insists its rare earth export controls are a reasonable response to what it describes as recent Trump administration moves to harm the Chinese economy.

“In just over 20 days, the U.S. has continuously introduced a series of new restrictive measures against China,” the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said. “The U.S. actions have severely harmed China’s interests and seriously undermined the atmosphere for bilateral economic and trade talks.”

The latest twist in the U.S.-China trade war that Trump reignited in February with the imposition oftariffs linked to China’s role in America’s opioid overdose epidemicbatters an already strained bilateral trade relationship weeks prior to a Nov. 10 deadline for a U.S.-China agreement aimed to restore predictability to those links.

The two countries agreed earlier this year to back off of tariff rates that went above triple-digits, but the U.S. has continued to deny China access to the most sophisticated computer chips due to concerns that they might benefit Beijing’s military-industrial complex. China has responded with an array ofnon-tariff trade retaliation measuresand cutpurchases of U.S. soybeansto underscore its negotiating muscle in ongoing trade talks. Those hostilitiesspilled over into the shipping sectorwhen Beijing announced Friday that it is matching the Trump administration’s planned increase in port fees on Chinese-owned and operated cargo vessels that go into effect on Tuesday.

The threat of a resumption of tit-for-tat tariffs and other measures that could pummel U.S.-China trade will spook shippers and retailers in the run-up to the holiday shopping season and reignite concerns of a fresh inflationary surge fueled by higher levies. It also casts doubt on the utility of four high-level meetings since May between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng aimed to restore stability to the U.S.-China relationship.

Trump appeared to address those concerns — which prompted the S&P to tumble more than 2 percent on Friday, its worst day since April — ina Truth Social post Sunday. “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment,” Trump said. “The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”

That assurance is likely to land flat in Beijing.

“The tariff truce is officially over, giving way to a new dynamic of mutually assured disruption,” said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington. “Each side will keep testing how far it can weaponize economic interdependence without triggering uncontrollable fallout.”"

President Donald Trump’s whirlwind tour of the Gulf last week– and the attendant blitz of AI dealmaking – promised numbers so absurd they seemed mystical. And no company was more at the center of the action than Nvidia.

The Santa-Clara based company, which makes the powerful chips core to training the world’s most sophisticated AI models, signed a deal to sell “several hundred thousand” of its most advanced chips toSaudi Arabia. Another deal is reportedly under discussion for Nvidia to sell more than a million chips tothe UAE.

Nvidia has recently emerged as a tentpole of the U.S. tech renaissance promised by Trump. It pledgedto invest$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S., and CEO Jensen Huangvisited the White Housein February, andattended a $1 million-a-head dinnerat Mar-a-Lago. On Trump’s trip to the Middle East, Huang joined the president in Riyadh along with a phalanx of other tech execs.

He summed up his philosophy just a few days before the Saudi trip: “We want to build the world’s AI, whereas American standards are being adopted around the world, the ecosystem of artificial intelligence will build on top of our standard versus somebody else’s standard,”Huang saidat the Milken Institute Global Conference. “If we leave a market altogether, there’s no question somebody else would step in.”

The “someone else,” of course, is China — the rival that American industrial policy is bent on keeping in check.

“The Middle East is an important market, and if the U.S. is not at the table, those countries will procure their chips from China and harm U.S. competitiveness,” one tech industry representative toldPOLITICO’s Ari Hawkinsafter the Trump administration announced the Gulf agreements.

But wait: Just one day after the U.S. and UAEunveiled a joint “AI campus”(reportedly with Nvidia’s involvement), Nvidia appeared to be planning a new research center in Shanghai.

TheFinancial Timesreported that Huang discussed the plan with Shanghai’s mayor last month and said it would include leasing new office space in the city for existing employees and a potential expansion, should the U.S. approve the plan.

Asked by DFD why Nvidia appeared to be increasing its China footprint at a time of growing U.S.-China rivalry, a Nvidia spokesperson said the company “is simply leasing a new space for existing employees, who need the room in the post-COVID return to work. The scope of work will remain unchanged.”

Its China plan served as a reminder that a big, profitable company might donate to the president’s inauguration and plow billions into domestic investments, but it is still a global force with its own interests.

“It’s the timing of it. They could have waited a week. They could have waited two weeks. Did you have to do it, literally the next day?” asked a former Obama administration official.

Nvidia, the second-most valuable company in the world, has long chafed at White House attempts to put rules around where its chips go. Starting in 2022, the Biden administrationbegan restricting the saleof advanced chips and chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies.

Nvidia adapted bydowngrading the speed and capacityof its most advanced chips to comply with the new curbs. It alsolobbied heavily againsta rule that Biden issued in his last week in office to place worldwide restrictions on high-end AI chips, to prevent them from leaking to China. (President Donald Trump’s administrationrescinded the rule in May, just before the high-profile Gulf trip.)

As U.S. policy on advanced AI chips has evolved, Nvidia has been doing its own AI statecraft in China. Within days ofa new Trump restrictionon sending certain Nvidia chips to China, Huangvisited Beijingin April and spoke to Chinese trade officials, reportedly telling them, “The China market is very important to us.”

Critics see Nvidia’s strategy overall as a willful sidesteppingof U.S. policy. “As the past few years have made clear, the U.S. government cannot rely on NVIDIA to draw its own red lines,” Janet Egan, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, wrote to DFD. “Its track record shows a consistent pattern of following the letter of U.S. export controls, not necessarily their spirit.”

Responding to reports of Nvidia and AMD selling huge volumes of chips to Saudi Arabia, House Select China Chair John Moolenaar (R-Mich.)wrote on X, “The [Chinese Communist Party] is actively seeking indirect access to our top tech. Deals like this require scrutiny and verifiable guardrails.”

That was on Tuesday. By the end of the week, news of Nvidia’s Shanghai expansion went public. A Republican China Committee spokesperson said the panel is reviewing Nvidia’s decision.

“I imagine no one is enthused by it,” one Democratic congressional aide told DFD about Nvidia’s Shanghai plans.

It’s not clear where the Trump administration’s trade policies will end up, but one sign came last week, when the Commerce Departmentpublished guidancethat shifted responsibility away from licensing rules, and toward the companies themselves by increasing their “know-your-customer” requirements.

“Now industry has the compliance burden on their own,” said Thea Kendler, who worked on export control policy as Assistant Secretary of Commerce during the Biden administration.

As the market leader, Nvidia will be at the center of that compliance burden. Kendler said the threat of jail time or losing an export license could be a significant deterrent to companies breaking the rules. Still, she said, “it’s going to be difficult.”

Is Elon Musk fading into the backgroundof Trump 2.0?

POLITICO’s Jessica Piper and Holly Otterbeinreported this morningon Musk’s diminished presence in GOP politics, as Trump has mentioned him less in social media posts and fundraising messages, his name has disappeared from briefings, and members of Congress have largely disengaged from the mogul.

Jessica and Holly asked the White House about this dynamic, and press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn’t mention Musk directly while responding: “The mission of DOGE — to cut waste, fraud, and abuse — will surely continue. DOGE employees who onboarded at their respective agencies will continue to work with President Trump’s cabinet to make our government more efficient.”

Polling haslargely shownMusk and DOGE unpopular. Sen. Jim Justice (R-W.V.) told Jessica and Holly that Musk is a “patriot” and “really trying to give up his time and do a lot of good,” but in its alliance with Musk the GOP “got too close to the fence.”

The Senate’s stablecoin billis back.

POLITICO’s Morning Moneyreported todaythat after bombing its initial vote, Republican leaders are preparing for another procedural vote that would bring the bill back into play. The legislation, led by Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), would create a new regulatory framework for stablecoins largely seen as favorable to the industry.

It’s unclear whether Republicans can garner any Democratic support after the party unanimously voted down the bill last time amid concerns about Trump and his family’spotential conflicts of interest in the crypto world.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) signaled to reporters last week that he wouldn’t move ahead on the bill without enough votes to overcome potential “poison pill” amendments. “Once they can agree on what they want it to look like and we think there’s more than 60 to pass it on the floor, there’s a group of people on that side who just want to blow it up, and they’ll try to do that on the floor,” he said. “So we need to know that there will be the votes to defeat … amendments.”

PROGRAMMING NOTE:The newsletter will be on hiatus from Aug. 25 through Sept. 1. We’ll be back to our normal schedule on Tuesday, Sept. 2.

WE WANT TO HEAR THE GOOD AND THE BAD:What do you think about National Security Daily and how we deliver the news every day to your inbox? Here’s your chance to tell us! Let your NatSec Daily hosts know what’s working for you, what isn’t and what we’re missing.Take the survey here.

Now on to the news of the day:

The Trump administration said today that it hasclosed a deal to take a 10 percent stake in Intel. That’s likely to intensify a debate among Washington Republicans over whether made-in-the-USA semiconductors are vital enough to national security to justify government intervention.

Your NatSec Daily host talked to conservatives whose thoughts ranged widely on the Intel deal right before it was announced.

On the one side of the ring are supporters likeROBERT BLAIR, who served as a tech expert in the first Trump administration’s Commerce Department and White House.

“There’s always been a desire within the national security community to have a purely U.S.-owned and managed fabrication capability for the most exquisite chips,” he told NatSec Daily. “I think the U.S. government needs to have this capability.”

Commerce SecretaryHOWARD LUTNICKhas framed the ownership stake in Intel as a way for the government to get an “equity return” on the billions of dollars in subsidies the company has received via the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act. The idea is that a government stake in Intel might tighten oversight and attract investors in the company as it tries to create a U.S. alternative for those cutting-edge chips, which today are almost entirely made in Taiwan and South Korea.

But that whiff of state intervention is anathema to small-government conservatives. EconomistSTEPHEN MOORE, a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told NatSec Daily, “we need to not subsidize failing companies.”

Sen.RAND PAUL(R-Ky.) derided partial government ownership of Intel as socialism. “When Washington plays investor, taxpayers get stuck with the risks while politicians and corporations carve up the profits. Today it’s Intel, tomorrow it could be any industry a future Commerce Secretary decides to control,” he told NatSec Daily in a statement.

In fact, the Trump administration is already looking to play a bigger role in other tech companies — to mixed reactions from the Republican base.

Last week, PresidentDONALD TRUMPconfirmed he agreedto let Nvidia and AMD resume sales of some of their semiconductors to China in exchange for a 15 percent cut of revenue (which twoTrump 1.0 natsec vetswarned would “give China’s rulers the technology they need to beat us”).

And even though Trump railed against the CHIPS Act (which gave billions of dollars to companies manufacturing semiconductors in the U.S.), he’snow considering usingsome of its funds to promote critical minerals needed for chipmaking.

CHIPS champion Sen.TODD YOUNG(R-Ind.), toldPOLITICO’s Morning Tech (for Pros!)this week that he was “encouraged that the Trump administration continues to explore ways” to ensure there’s at least one viable U.S. entity in the domestic semiconductor supply chain.

Blair said he anticipated the Trump administration would have its way on Intel despite his party’s skeptics. As an example, he pointed to a dealannounced in Julyby the rare earths company MP Materials that would make the Defense Department the firm’s largest shareholder — a deal Trump officialssaid may be replicatedwith other rare earths producers.

“The libertarian arm of the GOP snipes from the sides but in the halls of power they’re quiescent,” Blair said.

No details of the Intel deal have been announced. The company has been on a roller coaster since Trumpcalled for the resignationof its CEOLIP-BU TANin early August over ties to Chinese chip companies.

Intel didn’t respond to NatSec Daily’s request for comment. Itsaid in a statementthis month that it was “deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests.”

HistorianCHRIS MILLER, author of “Chip War,” warned that there are national security risks of propping up Intel as well — if the company’s technology fails to keep up with Chinese rivals.

“If the U.S. government pushes companies to produce at Intel and the technology doesn’t work as expected, those companies will wind up with inferior chips,” Miller said.

In a show of how unpredictable the debate over Trump’s Intel plan is getting, progressive Sen.BERNIE SANDERS(I-Vt.) threw his support behind the idea. He told NatSec Daily, “if microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.”

FAMINE FEARS CONFIRMED:A leading United Nations body has determined that a man-made famine is occurring in Gaza,our colleague Elena Giordano reports.

The report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, published today, said that famine in Gaza is “entirely man-made” but that it could be “halted and reversed” if immediate action is taken. The determination is a dramatic, though expected, move from one of the most trusted observers of food security around the world and follows months of warnings about the precarious humanitarian situation in the territory.

Israel, predictably, has lashed out at the United Nations for its findings, arguing the report is biased. In a statement, Israeli Prime MinisterBENJAMIN NETANYAHUreiterated his denial today that Israel is intentionally starving Gazans and argued Israel has allowed enough aid to enter the territory.

Humanitarian groups say the IPC finding confirms what they’ve already seen on the ground in Gaza, and the starvation even their local workers are experiencing.

“There is still time to save lives, but only if Israeli authorities enable humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded and at the scale needed,” said Mercy Corps chiefTJADA D’OYEN MCKENNA. “We are not facing a logistics, capacity or resource problem. What’s missing is not the ability to respond, but the political will to allow it.”

BOLTON GETS RAIDED:The FBI searched former national security adviserJOHN BOLTON’s house this morning in search of potentially mishandled classified information,our colleagues Josh Gerstein, Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing and Kyle Cheney report.

Allegations from Trump that Bolton mishandled classified info are far from new. During the first Trump administration, top intelligence officials accused Bolton in sworn affidavits of divulging classified details from sensitive meetings that he wrote about in his memoir. The Department of Justice opened a probe into Bolton’s publication of classified information during Trump’s first term, but the investigation was dropped when the Biden administration came into office.

But the move to search Bolton’s house fits into a recent pattern of aggressive action by the administration against the former Trump aide, which has included revoking his security detail (despite threats against him by Iran) and his security clearance.

Trump denied advance knowledge of the search, but administration officials hailed the operation. FBI DirectorKASH PATELwrote on X that “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.”

Attorney GeneralPAM BONDIreplied to Patel’s post, writing “America’s safety isn’t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

Vice PresidentJD VANCEinsisted that the raid was not in retribution for Bolton’s long-standing criticism of the president’s temperament and approach to relations with Russia, per a video clip of an interview with NBC News’KRISTEN WELKERthat will air Sunday on “Meet the Press.”

LAVROV MEETS THE PRESS:Russia has taken an unusual step as it pushes its negotiating conditions for peace with Ukraine — booking its top diplomat on the longest-running show in television history and bringing some spice to Sunday morning.

Russian Foreign MinisterSERGEY LAVROVjoined “Meet the Press” for a rare English-language interview with Welker (Lavrov joined remotely from Moscow). NBC has also released some previews of the “Meet the Press” interview, which was pretaped and will air in full Sunday. In one of those clips, Lavrov tells Welker that “Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda is ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all.”

When Welker followed up on that, Lavrov accused Ukrainian PresidentVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYYof dragging out talks. “Zelenskyy said no to everything. … How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?” he asked.

It’s rare for foreign officials to appear on the Sunday shows, let alone Moscow’s top diplomat. But foreign officials have at times used the Sunday shows, “Meet the Press” in particular, to explain themselves to Washington. The move to get Lavrov in front of the cameras suggests that the Kremlin is looking to directly relay its vision for peace to the stakeholders in Washington who religiously watch the Sunday shows.

At the same time, though, the prospects of a summit are looking increasingly dim.As our own Eli Stokols, Dasha Burns and Felicia Schwartz reported today, both sides are increasing their demands, and negotiations, per one White House official, are becoming a “grind.”

TOUGH WEEK FOR THE IC:Defense SecretaryPETE HEGSETHfired the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency today, capping off a brutal week for the intelligence community.

Hegseth dismissed Lt. Gen.JEFFREY KRUSE, the head of DIA, today. He’s the most recent intelligence chief to get canned, after the administration fired the top leaders at the National Security Agency and other intel bodies. DIA had authored an assessment that directly contradicted White House claims that strikes against Iran “obliterated” the U.S. adversary’s nuclear weapons program.

It’s the latest blow to the intelligence community. While the administration did name a new potential candidate to serve as deputy director of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, it has taken a hatchet to the nation’s patchwork of intelligence agencies.

Director of National IntelligenceTULSI GABBARDannounced plans Wednesday to cut staff at the office of the Director of National Intelligence by half, cutting election security and nuclear nonproliferation programs in the process, and Gabbard on Tuesday also revoked the clearances of 37 people accused by the White House of politicizing intelligence. That included a top NSA data scientist who the agency recruited out of high school and NSA leadership fought to keep.

CBS reported Thursdaythat Gabbard also blocked U.S. intelligence agencies from sharing information with Five Eyes partners about the Ukraine talks, despite the one-to-one intelligence sharing relationship between the countries.

ARMING THE GUARD:The National Guard in Washington will now be armed, the Pentagon announced today.

As our own Nicole Markus and Paul McLeary report, Hegseth made the decision that the guard members deployed to the nation’s capital will conduct operations with “service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training.” Previously, guard members were unarmed as they patrolled the city.

That’s likely to further rattle antsy residents of the nation’s capital, who havelargely opposed Trump’s shows of forceagainst alleged crime in Washington. The city has embraced signs of resistance to the mobilization of the guard, including the symbol of a man throwing a sandwich at the guard that’s popped up in urban art across the city.Protests however have been minimally attended.

HUNGARIAN HEADACHES:Hungarian leaderVIKTOR ORBÁNtattled to Trump about a Ukrainian drone attack that hit a Russian pipeline which services Hungary with Russian energy. And Trump is siding with Budapest.

As our colleague Csongor Körömi reports, Orbán wrote a note Aug. 13 to Trump complaining about the strike. Trump responded in a letter Orbán’s political party posted to social media saying “Viktor — I do not like hearing this. I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia.”

The letter highlights how figures like Orbán and Slovakian leaderROBERT FICO, who was also outraged by the pipeline bombing, are becoming more emboldened to criticize Kyiv with Trump in the White House.

—President Donald Trump is ramping up pressure on chip companies with his latest jaw-dropping tariff threat,following deals he secured involving Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.

— The Commerce Department is expanding the number of derivative products targeted with steel and aluminum tariffs.

— Republican lawmakers are rebuking Mexico over its treatment of an Alabama-based construction company.

CHIP WAR 2.0:The global technology industry has more questions than answers after Trump floated 300 percent tariffs on semiconductors, raising the stakes for chip companies already straining to pacify the administration.

“I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say, chips — chips and semiconductors,” Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. “I’m going to have a rate that is going to be 200 percent, 300 percent,” he said.

The remarks are the latest in Trump’s steady drumbeat of trade threats.Earlier this month, he proposed a100 percent tariffon semiconductors, while indicating that companies who commit to manufacturing in the U.S. would be exempt. That was already an escalation after Trump said in January tariffs on chips could be aslow as 25 percent.

“Nobody knows what’s going on or what to take seriously at this point,” said one lobbyist for an industry group that represents some of the world’s largest tech companies, adding that the move was designed to pressure more chip companies into making investment commitments. “Nvidia and AMD were the focus last week; now it’s TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] and Samsung. Smaller chip companies will get caught up, too.”

Who it would hit:Higher tariffs on chip companies would mostly affect foreign chipmakers in regions like Taiwan and South Korea, depending on how the duties are imposed.

But American chipmakers will likely still face complications. While companies like Nvidia design their own chips, they still depend on foreign firms to manufacture them before they’re sold.

Pressure campaign:The move comes as tech companies cozy up to the Trump administration in a bid to avoid tariffs and other trade curbs like export controls.

But in Trump’s latest remarks, he declined to clarify whether firms that have recently expanded in the U.S. will still face tariffs — like Apple, whichpledged $600 billion in domestic investmentover the next decade — and it’s unclear if his earlier assurances still applies.

Trump has also not clarified how enforcement would treat firms that split production between countries, as many of the largest U.S. chipmakers and tech companies do.

Reminder:China hawks from both parties last weekraised national security and legal concernsover Trump’s decision to approve a deal allowing the sale of certain AI chips from Nvidia and AMD to China in exchange for 15 percent of the revenue.Democrats sent multiple lettersdemanding that Trump reverse course.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government is in talks with Intel about taking a stake in the company,Bloomberg reported,following a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and the president last week. Trump had previously called the CEO “highly conflicted” over his supposed ties to Chinaand called for his firing.

METAL TARIFFS WIDEN:The Commerce Department opted to widen the number of derivative products facing 50 percent tariff on steel and aluminum, imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security is adding 407 codes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, following comments filed by outside stakeholders, according to a public document,scheduled to be publishedon Tuesday.

Why it matters:The update partly fulfills a long-standing request from the U.S. steel sector and comes after months of meetingsbetween domestic steel makers and White House officials.

Who it could hit:The move is a disappointment for other sectors, particularly companies that rely on inputs of steel and aluminum for products that are still produced and sold in the U.S.

ERS DELAYED:More than six months after Trump announced plans to manage tariffs through an “External Revenue Service,” the agency’s creation has stalled amid a turf battle between administration officials and tariff revenue falling short of Trump’s projections.

The neglect of the ERS is fueling doubts about whether the administration still plans to turn that revenue into rebate checks or other tangible benefits.

Your host has more here.

GOP SEEKS VULCAN REPRISAL:A growing number of Republican lawmakers are piling pressure on Mexico over its supposed takeover of a port and limestone quarry facility from the Birmingham-based company Vulcan Materials.

Sen.Bill Hagerty(R-Tenn.) told Morning Trade that the Mexican government has used law enforcement and military personnel to “invade, occupy and shut down the Vulcan Materials facility,” in Mexico.

Vulcan Materials is the largest producer of construction materials and serves more than two dozen U.S. states and some territories abroad.

Referring to Mexico, Hagerty added that the port could be used against the United States, “if, for example, they decided to lease it out to one of the United State’s adversaries, like the CCP,” using the acronym for the Chinese Communist Party.

Long-standing rebuke:Hagerty is among thebipartisan group of lawmakerswho in July reintroduced theDefending American Property Abroad Act,which would let the U.S. bar vessels from its ports if they used facilities illegally taken from U.S. companies.

The main problem:But even as congressional focus grows, without Trump’s intervention, options for immediate retaliation are limited. Lawmakers who spoke to your host declined to offer a timeline or specify a path for the bill’s advancement.

A history of woes:In May 2022, Mexican military forces shut down Vulcan’s production and port activities at its subsidiary in Quintana Roo, which was followed the next year by Mexican military and police forces forcibly entering and seizing Vulcan’s port facility at Punta Venado.

DIGITAL DELAY?South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, the nation’s competition regulator, may hold off on introducing new rules for online platforms until tariff negotiations with the U.S. are concluded.

“The antitrust authority cannot independently proceed with the so-called Online Platform Act at a time when the U.S., which has the most influential hegemonic power, makes unprecedentedly strong trade demands to Korea,” Ju Biung-ghi, chair nominee,told local reporters on Thursday, referring to a recent proposal.

The update comes about a week before South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is scheduled to meet with Trump in the White House.

Backing up:U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has repeatedlypressed South Korean negotiatorsto drop antitrust proposalsamid concernsthey would unfairly target U.S. tech firms like Apple, Meta and Coupang with strict regulations, as part of broader trade negotiations.

— The Trump administration is facing scrutiny over its decision to pause port feeson China-linked ships for one year as part of broader trade negotiations.

— Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump’s promiseto deliver Americans a dividend of $2,000 per person from tariff revenue could be reflected in tax policy.

— A pair of House Democrats is rolling out legislation to crack downon profit-sharing deals the president made with some chipmakers.

PORT FEE PAUSE:Democrats in Congress, joined by labor unions, are condemning the Trump administration’s decision to delay port fees tied to an investigation into China’s shipbuilding practices, a move thattook effect today.

“A pause or reduction in the collection of port fees established under Section 301 will only further delay progress on rebuilding this critical sector in the U.S.,” warned House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party ranking memberRaja Krishnamoorthi(D-Ill.) and Rep.John Garamendi(D-Calif.) in a letter dated Friday andfirst obtained by Morning Trade.

Context:The Trump administration on Thursday opened an unusually short29-hour public comment periodfor its plan to implement a one-year pause on fees for China-linked vessels at U.S. ports, part of broader negotiations aimed atcurbing China’s dominance in global shipping.The fees briefly went into force last month.

USTR has also halted its plan to impose 100 percent tariffs on imports of ship-to-shore cranes and chassis from China, according to a notice. Those duties were set to take effect on Sunday.

“It appears the President has not secured any meaningful commitments from Beijing on terminating its nonmarket practices in the shipbuilding sector in exchange for delaying implementation of port fees,” the Democrats wrote in the letter, sent to OMB Director Russ Vought and USTR Jamieson Greer. “Meanwhile, American workers and industry will continue to feel the economic pain of the PRC’s unfair and anticompetitive practices.”

A group of labor unions echoed the sentiment, warning the Trump administration’s pivot will allow China to get away with “predatory behavior” in global shipping, according to written commentsfiled by theUnited Steelworkers, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

One step back:Union groups first requested then-President Joe Biden to investigate China’s practices in March of last year and made a number of suggestions, including a fee imposed on Chinese-made ships that dock at U.S. ports to load or unload cargo, with the proceeds going to help fund domestic shipbuilding.

The investigation, conducted during both the Biden and the second Trump administrations, found that “China’s targeting of the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors for dominance … is actionable”under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act,serving as the legal basis for imposing tariffs.

Moolenaar mum:GOP lawmakers — including several whoinitially supported the port fees,such as China Committee ChairJohn Moolenaar(R-Mich.) — have largely stayed silent over Trump’s pivot. A representative for Moolenaar did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

PAYDAY? DON’T HOLD YOUR BREATH:Trump said tariffs on foreign goods will lead to “a dividend” of $2,000 per person — and could be even more,POLITICO reported Sunday.

“A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” Trump saidin a poston Truth Social that began: “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!”

But asked about Trump’s comments in an interview on ABC News’ “This Week,” Bessent tempered expectations.

He suggested that the dividend could take the form of paying for “the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president’s agenda,” citing the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, among other things.

“I haven’t spoken to the president about this yet,” Bessent said.

He added that while an initial result of tariffs is to generate a surge of revenue for the government, the long-term goal is to “rebalance trade” by restoring manufacturing to the United States. The increase in manufacturing would lead to a decline in tariff revenue, Bessent said, but would bolster tax revenue.

“It’s not about taking in the revenue. It’s about rebalancing,” Bessent said.

FIRST IN MORNING TRADE:Rep.Sydney Kamlager-Dove(D-Calif.) is joining Krishnamoorthi to introduce legislation that would crack down on revenue-sharing agreements like those Trump struck with U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which let the companies continue selling certain chips to China despite national security concerns.

“Trump cannot keep brazenly violating the law and putting his deal-making ego above America’s security,” said Kamlager-Dove in a statement to Morning Trade. “The constitution and existing law clearly ban the Administration’s move to charge a fee in exchange for the ability to export dual-use technologies abroad, and for good reason.”

The so-calledBIS License Fee Prohibition Actstates that any fee linked to an export control license cannot be collected and must be returned, which supporters argue would serve as a safeguard to block Trump from pursuing similar arrangements with other companies.

Reminder:Trump over the summer signed deals with Nvidia and AMD in which the companies agreed to pay the U.S. 15 percent of their revenue from sales of artificial intelligence chips in China to get a government export control license.

RARE EARTH FIGHT DE-ESCALATED:China suspended a ban on exporting some dual-use materials to the United States, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced Sunday, following the easing of trade tensions between the two nations,POLITICO Europe reports.

The move coversexports of gallium, germanium and antimony, which are used in the production of advanced semiconductors needed for smartphones and in computing. The materials arealso used in military technologies,such as electronic warfare and surveillance systems, and, in the case of antimony, missile systems and ammunition.

Politico,Trump’s latest trade ‘deal’ with China underscores key U.S. disadvantage,2025-06-11T13:43-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/11/trump-announced-another-deal-with-china-will-it-hold-00400288,"After two days of talks in London, China and the U.S. announced the outlines of an agreement to honor a deal they agreed to last month in Geneva.

For the second time in two months, President Donald Trump on Wednesday touted a “deal” with China. There’s one problem: It’s largely the same deal the two countries agreed to last month.

And the initial readouts of the handshake agreement underscore just how far the Trump administration is from achieving its larger goals in the trade negotiations with Beijing.

“The two sides have already met once to try to de-escalate and basically agree to stop punching each other in the face with extreme tariffs,” said Emily Kilcrease, a former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative from 2019 to 2021. “And now they’ve come back together to say ‘Yes, we’ve already agreed we should stop punching each other in the face. Let’s actually stick to it this time.’”

Speaking late Tuesday in front of the ornate London mansion where they’d just held two days of talks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told reporters the world’s two largest economies had agreed to ratchet back actions both sides have taken since they announced an initial deal to cool tensions on May 12. The “framework,” as officials from both countries described it, still needs to be approved by Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and many elements remain outstanding.

But the emerging details suggest the Trump administration is at a disadvantage. While the U.S. is promising additional concessions on the export of certain sensitive products to China and restarting Chinese student visas, Beijing has only recommitted to a pledge it made a month ago — lifting its blockade on shipments of critical minerals, which are essential components of everything from cars to computers to defense equipment. China controlled nearly 70 percent of the world’s mine production of those minerals in 2024,according to the U.S. Geological Survey. And control of that spigot is proving to be the ultimate pressure point in any tit-for-tat trade war.

“This is another band aid,” said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the chief economist of the China Beige Book, a report that publishes data on the Chinese economy. “The Chinese can decide six months from now, ‘we don’t like what you said about the party,’ or ‘somebody was mean to Xi Jinping.’ They can decide that and cut off rare earths again.”

One person close to the White House and in touch with the delegation in London acknowledged the advances made in the latest round of meetings are small and tentative. “The administration knows that any deal with China isn’t worth the paper it’s written on, but they can at least try to move the ball forward,” said the person, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the state of negotiations. “This is not a trade deal. It’s a framework and there’s still a lot of details to be negotiated.”

The Trump administration, however, hinted at how desperate it is to restart the flow of critical minerals from China by offering to partially remove one of its biggest sources of leverage against China: export controls on sensitive technologies.

In his remarks to reporters Tuesday night, Lutnick said some of the export restrictions the U.S. has imposed on China in recent months on things like airplane parts and semiconductors and software would “come off … in a balanced way, when they approve the [critical minerals’] licenses.”

Kilcrease called that a “very dangerous precedent.”

“There was always this view that the U.S. will impose export controls because it’s a matter of national security, and because it’s a matter of national security, we don’t negotiate over it. Now you’ve given China an opening in every single future conversation to come back in and push the United States on export controls,” she said. “And they’re not just going to push on the kind of new export controls that were put in place for leverage. They’re also going to push on the chip controls, the AI controls, all of the controls that they have hated for decades. We just opened the door to that.”

Dating back to the first Trump administration, the U.S. has used export controls as aggressively, if not more, than tariffs to reshape the U.S. relationship with China. The Trump administration has taken steps to widen that effort since the start of his second term in office, targeting lower grade chips used in everyday electronic devices, beyond what’s traditionally considered sensitive technology. Senior officials, particularly Lutnick, have vowed to strengthen controls and step up enforcement.

Despite those pledges, the U.S. faces pressure from top business leaders to loosen controls and allow greater access to the Chinese market, a pressure that isn’t matched in China’s authoritarian government.

Meanwhile, China holds a near monopoly on the global supply of rare earths — metallic elements essential to both civilian and military applications. And since December Beijing hasimposed export restrictionson 11 such minerals as a second front in its deepening trade war with the U.S. and other Western countries.

All of those minerals are on the U.S. Geological Survey’slist of 50 “critical minerals”essential to “the U.S. economy and national security.” They include antimony, necessary to produce munitions, samarium which goes into precision weaponry and germanium which is a key to the production of military night vision equipment.

The U.S. has begun taking steps to develop its own rare earth mining and refining capabilities, starting under former President Joe Biden. But it remains decades behind Beijing in terms of domestic production and processing facilities, partly because of China’s own strategic and largely state-backed investments and efforts to flood the global supply chain.

China’s dominance over that supply chain, and the U.S.’s relatively small stockpile, makes it possible to put pressure on the U.S. side in a way that the administration has struggled to replicate.

“China has always had this trump card, they know how to use it, they’ve done it in the past and there’s no reason to suspect that they wouldn’t play it going forward,” said Marc Busch who has advised both USTR and the Commerce Department on technical trade barriers and is now a professor of international business diplomacy at Georgetown University.

It is unclear how long this current trade truce will hold. Beijing isn’t completely toning down its rhetoric despite the temporary reprieve. China’s Commerce Ministry described the export restrictions on rare earths as “common international practice” due to their “military and civilian purposes” in anX post Monday.

And Chinese state news agency Xinhua called criticism of those curbs “misleading hype” and defended them as a “responsible measure to uphold international nonproliferation measures”in an X post Tuesday.

The Chinese government, meanwhile, has not commented on the framework agreement reached in London, beyond vague statements by its delegation heads. China’s lead international trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters,per Chinese state media that“the two sides have agreed in principle the framework for implementing consensus.” Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng called the London meeting “an important consultation” without elaborating on its details, Chinesestate media reported Wednesday.

Beijing took a more gloating tone in a Xinhua state news agencyoped published Wednesdaythat portrayed the Trump administration as the loser in its trade spat with China. “Washington was forced to spend billions in subsidies to offset farm losses, while companies struggled with rising costs of imported parts. The net effect has been supply chain chaos, business uncertainty and a lack of any clear strategic gain,” said the oped.

Still, one Trump ally said that framework marks “a critical step and traditional sign of progress in trade negotiations.”

“Beyond Geneva, it opens up the ongoing negotiations. Progress on trade agreements is always incremental, complexity takes time,” said the Trump ally, granted anonymity to speak candidly about the negotiations with China. “Both sides have political and economic vital interests to protect and advance.”

Trump, meanwhile, continues to push for a face-to-face meeting with Xi, which has been a diplomatic focus for much of his second term. After a call with Xi last week, Trump said that he had invited the Chinese Communist Party leader to the White House and that he had accepted an invitation to China and would visit “at a certain point.”

Any such meeting could hold more water than the formal negotiations, which have been led by Trump’s triumvirate on trade: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Greer and now Lutnick.

“Unless we get a Trump-Xi meeting, I don’t see that we can write an agreement that will stand,” Scissors said. “And it won’t stand, because the Chinese will remain aggressive as they have been the entire time Xi Jinping has been in his party position, which is now 12 and a half years, and because the US will remain volatile While Donald Trump is president.”"
Politico,Trump claims China ‘doesn’t want to’ invade Taiwan,2025-10-20T14:14-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/20/trump-claims-china-doesnt-want-to-invade-taiwan-00615508,"President Donald Trump brushed off a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan on Monday.

President Donald Trump brushed off a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan on Monday, making a rare remark about how his administration views the future of the island amid increasing threats from Beijing.

“I think we’ll be just fine with China. China doesn’t want to do that,” the president told reporters in response to a question about President Xi Jinping’s appetite for invading Taiwan. “As it pertains to Taiwan, and that doesn’t mean it’s not the apple of his eye, because probably it is, but I don’t see anything happening.”

The optimistic assessment comes ahead of a planned meeting with Xi at the end of October in South Korea. Trump hopes to use that visit to strike a trade deal and de-escalate the increasingly fraught U.S.-China relationship, which has seen the two leaders regularly threatening aggressive economic policies meant to punish the other.

The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has stayed away from irking Xi on military matters, instead focusing on trade, specifically getting more U.S. goods into China.

But concerns remain about just how willing China is to make good on its “One China principle” — the belief that Taiwan is a part of China — and take hold of the island, which produces the majority of the world’s sophisticated semiconductor chips. China analysts say the People’s Republic could invadeas early as 2027amid increased Chinese incursions in the Taiwan Strait and elevated military presence in the South China Sea and East China Sea.

“First of all, the United States is the strongest military power in the world by far. It’s not even close,” Trump said, tamping down anxiety surrounding the next possible conflict. “We have the best equipment. We have the best of everything, and nobody’s going to mess with that. And I don’t see that at all with President Xi. I think we’re going to get along very well.”

This is only the second time Trump has publicly spoken about Taiwan since taking office in January. In August, Trump said Xi had told him he wouldn’t invade as long as Trump was president.

“President Xi told me that, and I said, ‘Well, I appreciate that,’ but he also said, ‘But I am very patient, and China is very patient,’” Trump told Fox News’ Brett Baier.

The president wouldn’t say if the independence of Taiwan will be a bargaining chip in his discussions with Xi on a trade deal in their upcoming meeting.

“I think when we finish our meetings in South Korea, China and I will have a really fair and really great trade deal together,” he said, threatening to up tariff rates by 100 percent if China doesn’t come to the table by Nov. 1.

Taiwan’s President Lai Chin-te told “The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show” on Oct. 7 that Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully talks down China from its military plans.

“We hope to continue receiving President Trump’s support. Should President Trump persuade Xi Jinping to permanently abandon any military aggression against Taiwan, President Trump would undoubtedly be a Nobel Peace Prize laureate,” Lai said at the time."

In Trump’s Washington,Europe’s tech regulation is a regular object of scorn. But there is one piece ofAmericantech policy that’s united European diplomats and U.S. industry: A rule issued in President Joe Biden’s final days in office that sorted the world into three tiers for AI chip export, with more than half of Europe left off the top rung.

Under theFramework for AI Diffusion, 17 EU countries were designated Tier 2, setting caps on their access to chips needed to train AI, while the rest of Europe was set for Tier 1, with no import restrictions. Countries listed in the second tier are treating it as a scarlet letter.

“We’re going around town trying to explain that we have no idea why we ended up in Tier 2,” said one European diplomat, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive talks. “If this has to do with cooperation with the U.S. on security, we are NATO allies, we are more than willing.”

The top rung includes France, Germany and Ireland; Tier 2 includes Switzerland, Poland and Portugal. No EU countries are in the third tier, where imports of advanced AI chips are not allowed. The EU’s tech and security commissioner Henna Virkkunenthis week saidthe framework goes “against the principles of the Single Market.”

European countries have found (polite) common cause with American tech companies that have blasted the framework, which is in effect as an interim final rule but requires compliance by May 15.

Chip giantNvidia panned the rule as“misguided” andOracle bashed itas “an over-prescriptive collision of jargon meets market allocation.”Microsoft said the rulecould push Tier 2 countries to “look elsewhere” for AI chips – and “become a gift to China’s rapidly expanding AI sector.”

The rule’s defenders say it’s necessary to keep the U.S. in the lead on a technology critical to national security. One tech adviser to the first Trump administration told POLITICO that while Trump repealed Biden’s AI executive order immediately after taking office, the diffusion framework could be a rare tech policy from his predecessor that sticks. “I don’t see this particular rule going away,” said the former adviser who was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic.

The Commerce Department, National Security Council and the State Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

But why did the Biden administration divide Europe into tiersfor chip exports? A person familiar with the Biden deliberations said the impetus for restricting chips was a landmark deal last April that saw Microsoft invest in the Emirati AI giant G42. The agreementraised alarmsabout U.S. chips used for developing AI ending up in China given theUAE’s ongoing security relationshipwith Beijing.

Reports of chipsmuggling to Chinavia third-party countries accelerated the push, the person said. Earlier AI-related export controls had been narrower in scope. The diffusion framework would be an ambitious new attempt to create a global licensing regime, the person familiar said. Internal disagreement delayed the rule for months, the person said, leading to therule being publisheddays before Biden left office.

Several Tier 2 countries are central tothe EU’s AI strategy. For example, Greece and Luxembourg were selectedamong seven sites for “AI Factories”that Brussels funded with 1.5 billion euros.

The person familiar with the Biden administration deliberations said a factor for Tier 2 was whether countries had adequate means to counter smuggling to adversaries like China or Russia.

Greg Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Tier 2 countries are overreacting.

“Most countries as soon as they heard the word tier 2 they knew they were opposed,” he said. “You can buy effectively unlimited chips, you just have to do it with relevant physical and cyber security measures in place.”

A diplomat from a second EU country on the Tier 2 list countered the framework was having an effect. “We have already seen that some investments have not gone through and the reason has been because of the framework,” the diplomat said.

Still, the alliance between Tier 2 European countries and U.S. tech companiesmay prove short-lived, at least under one possible solution offered by the person familiar with the Biden administration’s crafting of the rule.

The person said hunger for American AI compute could be a powerful lever to scrape back European tech regulations that have resulted inbillion-euro finesfor companies including Meta, Apple and Google.

“In hindsight,” the person said, “the division of Europe into Tier 1 and Tier 2 can be used as a great negotiating tool.”

Comments on the framework are due by mid-May, and the Trump administration isconsidering revisionsto “streamline” and “simplify” the framework. A trade that would slim down European tech regulations would align with Trump’s recent comments calling EU competition law “a form of taxation;” Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Chair, called EU content moderation“censorship”.

But if the White House tries to reboot the rule at the expense of EU tech regulations, a clash with Brussels is all but inevitable. The first EU diplomat said, “I don’t think anyone in the EU, especially the Commission, would go for that.”

Mounting concerns about genetic data privacyin the wake of 23andMe’s dramatic collapse are stress-testing California’s uniquely tough privacy laws, demonstrating the real-world challenges of actually implementing the protections outlined on paper.

California has some of the strongest privacy laws in the country — and the only dedicated privacy agency — but 23andMe has revealed the limits of legislation when the worst happens, with even the state attorney general admitting he struggled to delete his own data from the company.

“This is the nightmare scenario,” state Democratic Sen. Tom Umberg,author ofCalifornia’s Genetic Privacy Rights Act, told our colleagues at California Decoded.

His 2021 law is coming in clutch right now for Californians scrambling to scrub their saliva from 23andMe’s database after the companyfiled for bankruptcySunday, leaving the fate of more than 15 million users’ data up for grabs.

Unlike in states with weaker laws, the company is legally required in California to safeguard genetic privacy and delete people’s information upon request as it navigates bankruptcy filings. Those obligations live on — at least on paper — after 23andMe sells, Umberg said.

But enforcing the law is a whole different beast, and it’s spawning hard-to-answer questions about how California ensures genetic data stays secure when disaster strikes.

Umberg and state Sen. Scott Wiener, who co-sponsored the state’s Delete Act for bolstering data protections, said it’s up to the state attorney general’s office to enforce the laws they wrote. They suggested the AG’s office should involve itself in the company’s bankruptcy proceedings to ensure 23andMe’s successor follows the rules, with Umberg telling us he planned to spell that out in a letter to the top attorney.

“If a company is violating the law by making it difficult for you to get your data deleted,” Wiener told us, “they can be sued.”

Our colleagues Tyler Katzenberger and Chase DiFeliciantonio unpack more on what the 23andMe fallout means for the Golden State and beyond in today’sCalifornia Decoded newsletter.

The Trump administration reversed its funding blockon the Open Technology Fund Thursday, granting an apparent reprieve to a government-backed nonprofit tasked with promoting global internet freedom.

According to POLITICO’s Anthony Adragna, U.S. Agency for Global Media senior adviser Kari Lake filed a document in federal court rescinding an earlier memo that had cut federal funding for the Open Technology Fund. The nonprofit sued to release $655,508 in grant payments last week after Trump signed an executive order earlier this month that sought to eliminate the organization’s functions.

The nonprofit helps people in repressive regimes access the open internet and avoid censorship via virtual private networks and encrypted messaging tools like Signal — goals strongly backed by many congressional Republicans.

Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich) | House handout

Hello, and welcome to this week’s installment of the Future in Five Questions. This week we interviewed Rep. John Moolenaar, the chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. That post puts the Michigan Republican at the center of some of the thorniest geopolitical issues, including winning the technological arms race with China.

Moolenaar talks to us about artificial intelligence and his ideas for an “America First AI Policy” that would keep the U.S. ahead, block China from accessing U.S. technology and expand international partnerships with appropriate guardrails.An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows:

What’s one underrated big idea in tech?

AI can be used as a weapon. From helping cyber criminals to building autonomous systems to injecting Chinese Communist Party propaganda directly to the U.S. public, AI has immense power — and we need to treat it that way.

And that starts with securing the chips that power it. And I co-sponsoredThe Chip Security Act, which is a bipartisan bill that would require location tracking for advanced American chips and mandate reporting if they’re diverted or misused. Right now, American chips are being smuggled into China and used to train AI models that serve the CCP’s military and surveillance state. And we can’t allow that.

When you think about it, in the Cold War we tracked nuclear material, and today we should be tracking advanced chips, because they’re just as strategically important.

That is a simple idea, but it could determine whether American innovation is used to protect freedom or to power authoritarian control.

What’s a technology that you think is overhyped?

I think the idea that high-end compute is the only path to AI is overhyped, and the Chinese model DeepSeek proves it. Even though there are restrictions on advanced chips, the CCP found a workaround, and they built an AI system that censors, surveils and pushes propaganda using stolen AI models and likely smuggled chips.

Our committee detailed all of thisin our DeepSeek report, and what it shows is that the CCP is adapting fast, and they’re not just chasing high-end hardware — they’re trying to indigenize the entire tech stack: [Graphics processing units], cloud computing and the tools to manufacture chips themselves.

So we need to think better, not just about cutting off chip exports, but about securing the entire ecosystem. The race is not just about who has the most powerful hardware, but it’s about who controls the platform and protects the values built into it.

What could the government be doing regarding technology that it isn’t?

We need to treat AI like the strategic asset it is, not just another tech trend. And I joined alongside ranking member [Rep. Raja] Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) in a bipartisan letter urging the Commerce Department to act — and act fast.

We need clear standards for AI safety and transparency before these models are deployed, especially in critical sectors like defense, infrastructure and finance.

That means safety testing, transparency requirements for new models and strong oversight of training data, so we don’t end up with CCP-style systems like DeepSeek, which are hardwired for propaganda and control.

We also need to build more capacity at home: More fabs, more data centers and more secure supply chains, and close the export loopholes. The CCP is trying to indigenize the full tech stack. If we don’t control the whole program, we’re giving them the tools to bypass our restrictions.

With our values, we need to lead globally — and our allies need to adopt similar guardrails — so that we can prevent Beijing from their techno-authoritarianism. We still have the edge, but if we want to keep it, we have to act like we intend to win.

What book most shaped your conception of the future?

Recently, I read “The Peacemaker” by William Inboden, and it shaped how I think about American leadership in the dangerous world that we have today.

It was about Ronald Reagan and about how he faced Soviet aggression, nuclear brinksmanship and economic instability, but he stood firm with moral clarity, military strength and a deep belief in America and our values.

It didn’t happen overnight. When you think of the Soviets launching Sputnik, America didn’t back down. We stepped up and invested in science, defense and education. And that wave of innovation allowed Reagan’s strategy to dominate technologically — and our strong military defense — but we also won the war of ideas.

That’s the advantage that free societies grounded in faith and truth have over these authoritarian regimes. I believe the future is going to be shaped by those who lead in AI, semiconductors and quantum, but even more so by those who defend the values beneath them. And Reagan showed how to lead with strength and with faith and we need to work with other like-minded nations to work together to defeat this authoritarianism — and some of these partnerships that are emerging with China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

What has surprised you the most this year?

What has shocked me the most when it comes to the work we’re doing with our select committee is how much of our American-made technology — our investor dollars and even our taxpayer dollars — are benefiting the Chinese military and surveillance state, and despite our sanctions, our export controls and national security warnings, the CCP is still building AI-enabled weapons using our chips, our money, our cloud services, even our research.

We need to get much more serious about our enforcement, and that’s precisely why we need an America irst AI policy to ensure America always retains a majority of global compute and leads the free world in this effort.

The White House’s plan to extract more investmentsfromsemiconductor manufacturers might actually be working — though the strategy may have its limits.

On Thursday, chip fabricator Micron said it wouldinvest an additional $30 billionto expand its Virginia plant, and construct a new facility in Idaho. This comes as President Donald Trump’s Department of Commerce renegotiates manufacturing grants that the Biden administration had agreed to furnish under the 2022 CHIPS Act. Micron received $6 billion in CHIPS funding last year, and will now get an additional $275 million, as well as a “white glove” service to loosen and expedite permitting.

In May, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration would demand that companies ramp up their investments if they wanted to receive the CHIPs grants they’d been promised. Trump has also claimed he’s been able induce extra investments by threatening companies with tariffs in renegotiations: He said in April that he raised the prospect of imposing100 percent tariffson the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, leading it to pitch in another $100 billion. (TSMC declined to comment on Trump’s version of events whenDFD asked earlier this week. Micron said it could not comment on whether tariffs were part of its renegotiations due to it being the quiet period before reporting quarterly results.)

As Trump notches wins in his pressure campaign, Chris Miller, the Tufts University historian who wrote the widely influential book “Chip War,”told DFD earlier this weekthat aggressive tactics can only take the White House so far. “Companies are not going to do more than is economically rational,” he said. “That will be a limiting factor in terms of what kinds of renegotiations we end up seeing.”

It seems like Trump hasn’t hit that limit quite yet.

The Los Angeles protests are reigniting the argument aboutmisinformation during moments of tumult, especially since AI may be making the problem worse.

As with other recent upheavals, like the George Floyd protests or Jan. 6, 2021, riot, misleading photos and videos taken out of context are circulating online — Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)reposted a clipof a burning car that was actually from 2020. AI is now complicating the situation even further. For example, a fakeAI-generated videoof a National Guardsman talking about “gassing” protestors gained hundreds of thousands of views this week.

POLITICO’s California Decoded teamreported on Fridaythat at least three Democratic state lawmakers are monitoring the situation, which they say emphasizes the need for AI legislation. “The AI-generated images are inflaming the situation,” state Sen. Josh Becker told Decoded, who added that theCalifornia AI Transparency Actwill eventually be sufficient to counteract such deepfakes. The law requires watermarks to signal that a certain piece of media was AI-generated. The act was passed last year, but won’t go into effect until January.

However, the First Amendment has stifled AI content laws in the past. A federal judge in October blocked California fromenforcing a banon deceptive AI content. While watermarks may seem less extreme than a ban, they may stillraise free speech issues.

Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to establish a global AI standards body.  | Adek Berry/AFP via Getty Images

When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited South Koreathis week, the centerpiece of his trip wasn’t some multibillion-dollar “Art of the Deal” transaction he’d brokered. Rather, it was his proposal to establish a global organization to set AI standards.

In the vacuum left by President Donald Trump — who flew home from South Korea before the conference officially started — Xi pitched a Shanghai-based group that would set rules for international AI governance. As my colleagues at POLITICO’sMorning Techreported, this would allow China — rather than America or Europe — to mold how the world approaches AI.

These aren’t just idle prospects. In fact, China now has a significant track record of shaping global tech policy, and by extension the global economy, by influencing theobscure international bodiesthat institute standards for the tech sector. While not as flashy as mega semiconductor deals, these organizations sketch out the blueprints for how technology is designed and used around the world, from 5G to satellites.

As we enter the AI age, China is now clearly laying the groundwork to shape the AI ecosystem with those international standards. What would that mean for the rest of the world?

A message from Meta:

Meta is investing $600 billion in American infrastructure and jobs, creating opportunities in communities across the country.

Phil, a Lead Building Engineer in Los Lunas, New Mexico, has seen the impact that Meta’s investment can bring.

“Supporting my family used to mean leaving my hometown and missing out on special moments,” he says. “Now, it doesn’t.”

Explore Phil’s story.

Its long-game strategy to wieldinstitutional power has already given China a lot of sway in debates over critical rules. The country has previously installed leaders at theInternational Telecommunication Unionto favor Chinese technologies and minimize security concerns with Huawei and ZTE. China has also been trying to get support from groups like the Internet Engineering Task Force, which sets technical standards for the Web, to adopt new online protocols that would make it easier to enable surveillance and censorship.

By shaping more and more standards in telecom, the internet and other sectors, China can quietly create a built-in advantage for its domestic companies.

“You’re talking about whose standards will be applied,” said Brett Schaefer, a former member of the UN’s Committee on Contributions. “If it’s a Chinese company, those will become the basis for working practices moving forward. It gives you a huge economic advantage.”

This is one of the wonkier, less-appreciated— but very important — subplots of China’s global rise.

It began after the 2008 housing crisis, according to Luke Hogg, director of tech and telecom policy at the Foundation for American Innovation. The U.S. government and Silicon Valley cut back on travel budgets for sending delegates to the conferences where these bodies discuss policy, and also hosted fewer of those conferences due to the expense. “The U.S. started to pull back [...] and the Chinese saw this as an opportunity to exert more influence in a lot of these places,” Hogg told DFD.

Over the last decade, China has formally integrated such efforts into its big-picture policy plans, like the Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project.

As fewer Americans attend these standards meetings, China has been increasing its delegations. The country has also given subsidies to domestic tech companies to encourage them to send more representatives. Its government makes an effort to staff some of these groups as well, especially at the United Nations.

“They’ve invested time and money to make sure that the Chinese place a lot of interns into UN bodies, and frequently those interns subsequently are hired as UN employees,” said Mark Lambert, who worked on the State Department’s Asia policy in the Biden and first Trump administrations. “They’ve done this very well, in a way that other members of the security council have not.”

The Chinese Communist Party is also effective at coordinating with domestic tech industries to boost its influence globally, sending company representatives to certain international meetings and official representatives to others. “They’ve been very creative,” Hogg told DFD.

Xi’s proposal to create an entirely newinternational AI body would give the country even more leverage over tech standards, if it can steer how the institution is set up.

There’s currently no singular, widely accepted AI standards organization to, for example, determine how exactly the technology can collect data. So the CCP can be the first mover.

The U.S., for its part, is aware of China’s strategy and officially says it wants to renew its involvement in the international standards community. Trump’sAI Action Planincludes a section on countering “Chinese Influence in International Governance Bodies,” which tasks the State and Commerce Departments with finding ways to leverage U.S. power through standards setting.

The White House did not reply to DFD’s inquiry about its efforts by deadline. But Office of Science and Technology Policy director Michael Kratsios has been attending international meetings to promote sector-specific AI standards, rather than an overarching body. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Mark Warner havealso introduced legislationto coordinate and fund U.S. participation in related meetings.

Hogg praised the initiative, but noted that “there is also a bit of muscle memory that’s been lost since the 2010s, so it’s not like we’ve seen an immediate phase shift in U.S. engagement in these bodies — it’ll be a long process.”

A message from Meta:

Former Federal Trade Commission chairand long-time tech industry adversary Lina Khan is back in politics, co-chairingNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s transitionteam — POLITICO’s Alfred Ng reports.

So-called “Silicon Alley” residents may be relieved to hear that Khan doesn’t plan to continue her anti-monopoly crusade against Big Tech. Instead, a Khan spokesperson told DFD, her focus will be on identifying personnel and policy recommendations for Mamdani’s progressive economic agenda.

“Honored to serve as co-chair of the transition as we work to build an administration that governs effectively and delivers a city where all New Yorkers can build a good life,” Khansaid in an X poston Wednesday.

The Department of Energy is investing $625 millionto bolster quantum research at its national labs.

The 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act initially established the centers to speed up research that could lead to breakthroughs in quantum science, and industry groups have been pushing Congressto reauthorizeit. As POLITICO’sKelsey Tamborrino reports, the DOE funding will help five labs improve superconducting materials, refine algorithms and chip components, scale quantum devices and enable large-scale quantum computers.

DOE undersecretary for science Darío Gil said in a statement, “The renewal of DOE’s National Quantum Information Science Research Centers will empower America to secure our advantage in pioneering the next generation of scientific and engineering advancements needed for this technology.”

Welcome to California Decoded!Happy Monday, hope you remembered to spring forward yesterday. Send feedback, tips and story ideas to[email protected]and[email protected].

FIRST IN DECODED:CHINA IN THE CROSSHAIRS —One of the California Legislature’s most outspoken conservatives is looking to crack down on businesses sharing personal information overseas amid national concern over China’s access to American data.

New legislation from Republican AssemblymemberCarl DeMaio, first shared with California Decoded, would require businesses to obtain consent from California-based users before sharing or storing their data in foreign countries.

DeMaio said his legislation is aimed squarely at China — and it comes as Congress and PresidentDonald Trumpare grappling with how to address bipartisan fears that the Chinese Communist Party is weaponizing data held by TikTok and other China-based platforms to spy on Americans. (TikTokhas refuted claims it shares data with CCP officials.)

“This is a national security threat,” DeMaio told Decoded in an exclusive interview. “Their tech companies are heavily dominated and controlled by the Chinese government.”

China hawkism is set to dominate the tech conversation in Washington this week. Trump yesterdaysaid there are four potential buyersinterested in purchasing TikTok’s U.S. operations after Congress forced the company to divest its American holdings or face a nationwide ban. And on Tuesday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representativewill hold an investigative hearingon China’s quest for dominance in the semiconductor industry.

But whether that talk will spur further action in Congress to protect Americans’ data from Chinese-owned companies is yet to be seen. Republicansalready have their hands fulltrying to unite their razor-thin House majority behind a budget resolution, meaning second-order issues like data privacy are stuck on the backburner.

“Even if something should be easy in Congress, it never is, and that’s particularly true on privacy and AI legislation,”Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission under the Obama administration, told Decoded.

And even if Congress advances a bill clamping down on overseas data sharing, there’s no guarantee Trump will sign it. The president hasbacktracked on the TikTok ban— despite kickstarting the idea during his first term — after conservative creators and Trump’s campaign used the platform to reach young voters during the 2024 election.

DeMaio said California needs to step up to fill the void with Washington in gridlock.

“California is the biggest player in technology,” he told us. “If we adopt this standard, it really does then have a cascade effect that would probably create a national standard.”

Whether DeMaio’s bill can pass in deep-blue California is also an open question, even though it targets a bipartisan issue. DeMaio has a reputation asan outspoken conservativein the Democratic-controlled Legislature, which could make his colleagues on the other side of the aisle skeptical of working with him.

Plus, his bill could attract opposition from Big Tech-aligned groups, even as the industry has aggressively courted conservatives following Trump’s reelection. Tech industry groups often argue that California businesses already maintain strict data privacy standards and that additional regulations would be unnecessary and costly.

DeMaio, anticipating pushback, said that “all good ideas will generate opposition.”

But he was confident that the issue would draw bipartisan support, even if any bill that ultimately lands on Gov.Gavin Newsom’s desk doesn’t have his name on it.

“I don’t care if someone takes a good idea and makes it happen. That’s all that matters to me. I don’t need the credit,” he said. “If my bill spurs that conversation, great.”

NOW— Trump meets with the Technology CEO Council at the White House.

INTERVIEW:TECHING UP THE PLACE —The mayor of the self-declared “Capital of Silicon Valley” wants the city to run more like — surprise — a startup. San Jose MayorMatt Mahantold California Decoded he plans to propose tying the pay of senior staff to improvements in areas like homelessness, an idea inspired by his time working at tech companies in the valley.

“I think this will be shocking to many people inside city hall,” Mahan said, outlining his idea before a public announcement as part of his annual budget proposal Tuesday.

Mahan spent the first half of his term wrangling with the San Jose City Council over what the city’s main priorities should be. Now he wants to take the techie tack of going all in on solutions and swiftly changing course when he’s not getting results.

Before becoming mayor, he ran small companies focused on voter engagement and fundraising and said he wants to model his approach on the ethos of the nimble startup.

The mayor said he’s expecting “quite a bit of discussion and debate” when the particulars are hashed out with the city council.

Translation:This could be a primetime political skirmish to watch in the Bay Area’s biggest city.

San Jose City CouncilmemberPamela Campostold Decoded she was wary of putting too much focus on just the numbers when it came to improving city services.

“What we don’t want is a system where leaders are competing for credit or prioritizing metrics over solutions,” Campos said. Asked if she supported the proposal, Campos said: “Overreliance on quantitative targets is going to prioritize short-term fixes over long term solutions,” adding, “We need more time to explore something like this.”

But a potentially bristling board is just the first hurdle.If the plan gets the rubber stamp, it would still have to be approved by voters next year.

Mahan said it’s the kind of change he campaigned on bringing to city hall, and that it would apply to department heads and other senior staff — himself included. He said getting the city totrack dataon issues like community safety and cleanliness was the first step.

Now comes the politically fraught portionof the show where the mayor will have to go up against the council to hash out what exactly a reasonable decrease in homelessness might be that warrants a pay bump, for example.

“I think we are now at a point after my two years in which we should be able to set targets, set actual goals, around our biggest priorities like ending unsheltered homelessness, and have a feedback loop which is so missing in the public sector,” Mahan said.

TECH ON THEIR TOES:The White House will soon task Commerce to conduct an investigation that could lead to new tariffs on semiconductors and potentially more electronics,your host reported on Sunday,in a move poised to fuel anxiety for the world’s largest technology companies.

One step back:The investigation will be launched under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to restrict imports deemed a threat to national security. The move would also lay the groundwork for greater friction with chip hubs in East Asia, such as Taiwan.

A White House official told your host the purpose of the probe is to “revive U.S. manufacturing in critical technologies” — and that Commerce plans to offer industry a public comment period. A final timeline for the investigation and an official start date has not been set.

What it means for industry:The update puts a damper on celebration from the technology industry after guidancepublished by the U.S. Customs and Border Protectionshowed that some chips as well as smartphones, computers and more electronics were excluded from the president’s so-called reciprocal tariffs.

The exemption was viewed as a win for tech companieslike Apple and Nvidia, which were facing potential price hikes amid manufacturing costs that would skyrocket under Trump’s tariff plans.

But Trump rejects that framing:“There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket,’”Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday.

“We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,” Trump wrote.

The expected chip probe is a thorn in the sideof not only the technology sector, but also a longer list of critical industries that rely on foreign inputs and had hoped the new guidance was a signal the president might provide a wider range of exemptions.

“Ever-changing trade policies are a recipe for mass confusion and declining optimism in the stability of the U.S. market,” Adam Thierer, senior fellow for the Technology & Innovation team at the free-market think tank R Street Institute, told Morning Trade.

But he added that doesn’t mean tech companies will all come out to immediately condemn the expected investigation, or bash Trump’s tariffs publicly. “A lot of people in the tech community are still holding their tongues a bit and hoping for a return to normalcy,” Thierer said.

Don’t be too surprised:Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday downplayed the guidance and suggested new tariffs would hit electronicswithin two months.

""[Trump is] saying they’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.

USTR weighs in:Meanwhile, USTR Jamieson Greer reiterated the need for new tariffs on semiconductors and downstream products onSunday in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,”and suggested new sectoral tariffs would be coming soon.

“It’s not really an exception. That’s not even the right word for it,” Greer said of the posted guidance. “What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera.”

PREPARE FOR DEAL-MAKING:Greer in the interview floated that trade deals with select partners could be coming together in the short term, saying “I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.”

State of play:The White House is in serious talks on reciprocal tariffs with only a select number of countries — Vietnam, India, South Korea and Japan — prioritizing existing trading partners that are strategic to countering China.

Despite the upbeat assessment from Greer,the White House’s approach has left most countries in the dark about how to permanently stave off Trump’s tariffs.

Even some nations actively engaged in negotiations have expressed confusion about the administration’s priorities and have cast doubt on whether a 90-day timeline is realistic, at which point Trump’s planned reciprocal tariffs are scheduled to snap back into force.

“We really don’t know what the Trump administration wants,” said one diplomat from an Asian country, who is close to the negotiations.

Politico,‘The president is obsessed’: Trump fixates on Xi call amid faltering trade talks,2025-06-03T10:00-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/03/trump-xi-call-trade-talks-00381858,"The White House says a call this week between the president and China’s leader is ""likely"" as it tries to restore a fragile truce in the U.S.-China trade war.

President Donald Trump thinks a call with China’s leader Xi Jinping will help reset souring trade talks. But even if that conversation happens this week, as the White House said is “likely,” it’s doubtful to be the breakthrough Trump is hoping for.

“The president is obsessed with having a call with Xi,” said one person familiar with the trade talks, convinced he can personally hash out deep-seated divisions between the world’s two largest economies mano a mano with Xi.

That conviction belies the difficult position the U.S. is in as it tries to pressure China to fundamentally reorder their nearly $600 billion trade relationship, without doing lasting political damage at home. And it renews questions about what Trump’s endgame is in a trade war with China that is increasingly turning into a game of chicken.

The person familiar with the trade talks, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about their private conversations, said the administration is under “a lot of pressure” because of China’s block on critical minerals, crucial components for everything from auto and electronics manufacturing to munitions production. “I don’t think Xi is too interested in exporting any more rare earths or magnets to the United States, he’s made his position clear,” the person added, though they predicted there’s a “good likelihood” Xi would take the call to at least hear Trump out. “The president has some leverage, and the question is when he’s ready to impose maximum pressure on the Chinese government.”

A former Trump official close to the White House, granted anonymity to candidly discuss the president’s strategy, said: “Trump feels like a call between principles is a way to cut through a lot of this noise, and get right to the heart of the matter.”

Other outside observers remain skeptical Trump will actually be able to get Xi on the phone. Since the start of the president’s second term, White House officials have been publicly promising a call between the leaders is imminent. Trump even tried to suggest throughoblique comments in Aprilthat the two had spoken since Trump’s inauguration.

“Beijing has a sharp nose for weakness, and for all his bravado, Trump is signaling eagerness — even desperation — to cut a direct deal with Xi,” said Daniel Russel, who was assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Obama administration. “That only stiffens Beijing’s resolve.”

The Chinese government has also been shaken by Trump’s public spectacles in the Oval Office — including high-profile meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa — which has made it wary of leader-level diplomacy.

“The PRC sees President Trump as unpredictable, which poses risks reputationally for President Xi,” said Rush Doshi, former National Security Council deputy senior director for China and Taiwan in the Biden administration. “It’s not usual practice for PRC diplomats to put the leader at risk of a potentially embarrassing or unpredictable encounter.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday that the leaders would “likely talk this week,” echoinga prediction National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett made Sunday. But a White House official, granted anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes conversations, said a call has yet to be scheduled.

Asked about a potential call during a press briefing on Tuesday,China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian replied, “I have no information to share on that.” The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a query about it. But a statement from China’s Commerce Ministry on Mondayaccusing the U.S. of “stirring up new economic and trade frictions” suggests they aren’t in a conciliatory mood.

It’s just part of the finger pointing that’s ensued since Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greerreached an agreementwith their Chinese counterparts in early May to lower tensions in a trade war that has threatened to capsize both economies. The deal brought U.S. tariffs on China down from a floor of 145 percent to 30 percent, while Beijing slashed levies on U.S. imports to 10 percent and promised to lift barriers on critical mineral exports. The deal gave both sides a 90-day deadline to launch a new dialogue on a broader trade deal to address U.S. grievances about Chinese trade practices.

But since then, miscommunication and conflicting expectations have ground new talks to a halt — before they even started. The Trump administration has accused the Chinese government of slow-walking its restart of shipments of critical minerals and rare earth magnets.

“When they agreed in Geneva to remove their tariff and their countermeasures, they removed the tariff like we did. But some of the countermeasures, they’ve slowed on,” Greer said on CNBC on Friday.

Automakers have started to warn thatimpending shortages of rare earth magnetscould force them to halt production and shutter factories in a matter of weeks. The magnets are critical to auto construction, from transmissions and fuel pumps to steering sensors and airbag actuators.

The two countries also remain stalled on the issue that ostensibly caused Trump to launch the trade war in the first place — fentanyl. China has offered two proposals to the White House, including one in February after Trump imposed his initial 10 percent tariff on China, Canada and Mexico.

“Everyone agrees that for any additional progress to happen on tariffs, the gateway is fentanyl,” said a business official, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.

But the U.S. has been unresponsive to the fentanyl offers, which were described as being intentionally designed by China to provoke a discussion about what Beijing could feasibly do to stem the flow of the precursors that Mexican cartels use to make the highly addictive drug.

Many Trump administration officials remain skeptical China will follow through with any agreement on fentanyl — underscoring the distrust some officials feel about the negotiations.

The Chinese government, for its part, has been angered by U.S. moves to limit U.S. exports for key Chinese industries, like semiconductors and aircraft, citing national security concerns.

Less than 24 hours after the Geneva announcement, the Commerce Department issued a warning to U.S. companies discouraging them from using chips made by the Chinese tele-computing giant Huawei, suggesting that using those chips would risk violating U.S. export control laws.

That caught Chinese officials by surprise, according to one business official granted anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “The Chinese side seems to legitimately believe that there was going to be this sort of 90-day stay of new actions, and that there might be some small things that happened, but nothing totally earth shattering,” said the official.

The U.S. has also angered China withnew moves targeting Chinese students studying in the U.S.

“The U.S. unilaterally keeps stirring up new economic and trade frictions, exacerbating the uncertainty and instability of bilateral economic and trade relations, and not only does it not reflect on itself, but also hits the other side with a backhanded accusation that the Chinese side violates the consensus, which is a serious deviation from the facts,” aChinese Commerce Ministry official said Monday.

Trump’s expectation that a call with Xi can reboot U.S.-China trade talks on those issues and render substantive results defies the diplomatic and policymaking protocols of China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party.

“Trump is a deal maker. Xi Jinping is not a deal maker — he’s a Party guy at the top of an administrative superstructure,” said Harry Broadman, a former assistant U.S. trade representative in the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. “I cannot imagine that Xi would get into specifics — at most they might agree on certain principles but that’s not likely to satisfy Trump.”

There’s also a risk that a call between the two leaders could backfire for Trump by undermining longer term trade negotiations with China.

“Elevating talks to the leader level might remove the ability to put together the kind of deeper and bigger deal that ultimately requires more consideration and time, so jumping to the leader level can be risky,” said former NSC official Doshi.

But the former Trump official dismissed the idea that there are major downsides to pushing for a Trump-Xi conversation. “From the U.S. perspective, what’s the big downside to the call? You ask for it. If they don’t do it, it’s like, ‘well, you know, we’re trying, they’re not even trying,’” the former official said. “And if they do it, maybe we get some progress.”"
Politico,Congress pulls the rug on U.S. plan to beat Huawei,2025-09-02T13:45-0400,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/02/congress-pulls-the-rug-on-u-s-plan-to-beat-huawei-00527620,"U.S. officials of both parties spent years struggling to develop homegrown alternatives to China’s telecom giants. The GOP abruptly defunded its biggest tool.

A global, six-year campaign to counter Chinese tech dominance took a hit this summer when Congress defunded a key research program to create a worldwide alternative to 5G giant Huawei.

In July’s One Big Beautiful Bill, Republicans cut the bulk of remaining grant money — nearly $1 billion — for the Wireless Innovation Fund, which was supposed to create a new, American-dominated type of 5G network.

The budget savings were used to pay for President Donald Trump’s tax cuts.

“To cut it came completely out of the blue,” said Sen.Mark Warner(D-Va.), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I think it’s crazy. It’s like a gift to China.”

The defunding is a major setback for America’s prolonged effort to root Chinese-made equipment out of the world’s telecommunications backbone. That campaign hasreached into the American heartland, causeddrama with alliesinternationally and even led to global intrigue when Huawei’s chief financial officer was arrested, extradited to the U.S., and later traded in a prisoner swap.

The program was launched to address the security risks created by the world’s dependence on Chinese telecom equipment. Worried about the dominance of Huawei and ZTE, Congress began paying to develop an alternative technology called an open radio access network, or open RAN.

The idea is still in the early stages, and although some companies have started to incorporate open RAN technology into their networks, it remains heavily supported by government money for research and deployment.

Warner, who secured the money in 2022with support from both Democrats and Republicans, believes the move this summer caught even some Trump administration officials off guard.

As recently as February, Trump talked up the technology in ameeting with Japan’s prime minister.

Many congressional Republicans, too, continue to support the idea. “We don’t want China to win,” Sen.John Cornyn(R-Texas), who unsuccessfully fought the cut, told POLITICO. “In the absence of U.S. developing alternatives like ORAN, I think there’s a risk that they will.”

The cut was spearheaded by Senate Commerce ChairTed Cruz, who framed the decision as fiscal responsibility.

The Texas Republican never commented publicly on the matter. In response to questions from POLITICO, his staff sent a list of talking points that the technology was flawed and not paying off as expected. A Cruz spokesperson declined to comment further for this report.

The crisis for open RAN demonstrates the challenges of using industrial policy to reshape an established marketplace — and to regain American footing in an area that it long since ceded ground.

The program was still relatively new, launched in 2023 with $1.5 billion in funding from the previous year’s bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.

When Cruz first floated the idea of clawing back the grant money in June, it set off surprise and consternation in both parties, including from senior GOP colleagues like Cornyn. The idea never appeared in House Republicans’ budget plans. But on Capitol Hill, Cruz’s office defended his objections to the program in a one-pager shared at the time with POLITICO, criticizing the lack of anoverarching strategyfor the grants and questioning whether they were accomplishing their goals. The cut quickly became part of the final version of the reconciliation package.

In the wake of the funding cut, the Trump administration says it still supports the broader objectives that drove the $1.5 billion program, and is still sensitive to alleged risks from China’s dominance of 5G technology.

“Seeing what China has done globally with rare earth restrictions raises questions about communications and other critical infrastructure,” said a U.S. official, who requested anonymity to describe delicate issues. “Resilience and security can only be assured when we work with trusted vendors.”

The official declined to answer questions about why Trump signed the open RAN cut.

In a June statement to POLITICO, a State Department spokesperson reiterated its support for open RAN, and said its diplomats were pushing the case “that secure technology is the foundation of a prosperous economy.”

That contradictory approach to the issue extends to Capitol Hill as well. Just days after Trump signed the reconciliation law slashing the remaining $850 million in open RAN grants, the House of Representatives unanimouslypassed a billdirecting the government to alert small companies to the benefits of open RAN — even letting them know about how to participate in the program the GOP had just gutted.

Open RAN has plenty of critics, including Cruz, who point out that the technology has been slow to develop. While some telecom companies have begun incorporating aspects of open RAN, the technology hasn’t been seen as widely transformative as initially hoped.

Skeptics also fear the current rollout would furtherentrench the existing telecom giants,including traditional European hardware playerslike Ericssonand Nokia, the largest non-Chinese 5G equipment makers, which integrated open RAN into their own marketing and offerings.

Cruz’s team also questioned open RAN on technical grounds, arguing in the June document that its technical architecture actually increases security vulnerabilities, and that in “a time of rising geopolitical cyber threats, policymakers should not push unproven architectures as the foundation of critical infrastructure.”

House Energy and Commerce ChairBrett Guthrie(R-Ky.) was among the first evangelistspushing for grantsfive years ago, but recently told POLITICO the cutback now seems “reasonable.”

“We fought for the open RAN program as it was developing and coming into being,” Guthrie said. “Eventually these programs have to stand on their own, and they can’t be funded forever. … With open RAN, there’s a lot of startup money, a lot of it’s been initiated, and now it’s time for it to live on its own.”

It’s not clear if that’s a viable option yet. Some longtime U.S. champions of the technology, including thetelecom companies EchoStarandMavenir, ran into financial challenges.

Supporters of open RAN research say the money cut by Congress could have addressed the looming challenges it was facing.

While the wireless fund’s initial rounds centered on hardware and broad R&D, the next grants were supposed to be devoted to the software challenges of operating an open 5G network — “kind of the game-changer for open RAN,” said Diane Rinaldo, who served in the first Trump administration and now leads the Open RAN Policy Coalition, which includes AT&T, Cisco, Google and Nokia as members.

Future funding rounds may have also sought to directly drive commercial deployment. She lamented the lost opportunities.

“It was incredibly unfortunate and upsetting to us,” Rinaldo said. “But it was about the money, not about open RAN — that was kind of made loud and clear to us.”

The industry was eager for the money: This spring, the administration announcedmore than 90 applicationsrequesting nearly $3 billion from the planned next round of funding.

A spokesperson for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Commerce agency administering the grants, said that research funding from the program’s first two rounds would continue, and that it’s still “exploring options” for pursuing the planned third funding round, without detailing specifics. (Accounting for the program’s full budget, there’s likely a small amount of funding left after the cut.)

Supporters are now on the hunt to take advantage of the administration’s other wireless research money, like R&D funding for 5G and 6G at the Pentagon, and to redouble efforts to convince U.S. officials of the technology’s global merits.

Its advocates acknowledge the speedbumps, but say getting the U.S. strategy on course may prove necessary to countering China.

“The truth is, ORAN has taken longer to implement than we’d hoped,” Warner told POLITICO. “But if we’re ever going to be competitive against Huawei, we have to move against the kind of traditional stack of equipment.”"

At the beating heartof the American artificial intelligence debate under President Donald Trump is anxiety about China, whose fast-moving AI capacities have raised fears of both economic dominance and security threats.

China’s rising tech power fueled the argument between Nvidia’s CEO and Washington’s national security world over the past week, after Jensen Huangaccused China hawksof being “unpatriotic” for wanting to limit the number of Chinese who come to the U.S. to study. That drew sustained blowback fromlawmakersand analystswho accused Huangof airbrushing reality.

Behind their concerns is Beijing’s policy of pouring billions of dollars into AI research, development, hardware and infrastructure in a bid to outgun Silicon Valley. The global AI competition with China drives Trump’sAI Action Plan, his microchip tariff policy, even much of his energy policy.

The economic fears are clear: It’s a powerful industry, and the country that wins the AI race will wield a technological edge that may grant it dominance in the 21st-century economy

The security threat from China, however, is more diffuse. When hawks wave the “national security” flag, they can be talking about issues ranging from military strategy to pop-culture propaganda.

“The Chinese have the highest quality AI of the actors we worry about,” said Kathleen Hicks, deputy defense secretary in the Biden administration. “At the strategic level, we’re less worried about Russian AI.”

So, when it comes to China, what’s the exact nature of the security threat? We asked four experts to break it down for us — and the answers run from the deeply wonky to the apocalyptic.

Cyberwar.In the simmering global battlefield of hacking, code-breaking and digital attacks, AI may supercharge Beijing’s alreadypotent cyberwarfare capabilities. Integrating AI into Chinesestate-linked cyberhacking operationssuch as Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon — which have already burrowed deeply into U.S. telecommunications and infrastructure networks — may enable them to become the ultimate killer app in future conflicts.

“AI is showing promise to accelerate, extend and automate different parts of cyber operations,” said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “That might mean it’s able to disrupt the navigational abilities or impact critical infrastructure on the home territory of an opponent.”

Chatbot spies.Amid the domestic anxiety about chatbots, one lesser-appreciated risk is their potential as espionage machines. The overlap of China’smilitary industrial complex with domestic tech firmsmakes the user data that DeepSeek and other Chinese AI systems collect fair game for the People’s Liberation Army. That’s because China’sNational Intelligence Lawobligates Chinese companies to “support, assist and cooperate with national intelligence efforts.”

Chinese AI applications “extract data as they go, and that data can be combined with other information and used in all kinds of ways by the Chinese state because of their civil-military fusion,” Hicks said.

If more Americans use Chinese-made chatbots, Beijing could weaponize that data through tactics including bespoke disinformation campaigns designed to sow chaos among specific segments of the U.S. population. (Imagine social media campaigns designed around the personal anxieties of first responders, banking sector workers or military personnel.)

Chinese AI chatbots don’t yet have the reach of U.S. rivals such as ChatGPT or Gemini.But that may change in the face of growing demand for AI services, and China’s improving capacity to build cheap, efficient AI platforms.

Propaganda narratives.The 2024 law to ban TikTok was driven in part by worries that its Beijing-linked parent company could manipulate the algorithm to show American users the content that China wanted them to see.

With AI platforms, this is already happening. Research published last week by the nonprofit media freedom advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders revealed that China’s three most popular AI chatbots — DeepSeek; “Ernie,” which is produced by Chinese search engine company Baidu; and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s “Qwen” chatbot —produced responses to more than 100 queries on 30 topicsthat consistently aligned with Chinese government rhetoric.

That could deliver Beijing a propaganda win in developing countries where the ubiquity and lower cost of Chinese products allow Chinese AI to dominate.

The effect: “A lot of answers or interpretations of inputs based on Chinese training and worldviews,” said Harry Krejsa, former assistant national cyber director in the White House’s Office of the National Cyber Director during the Biden administration.

“Data poisoning.”U.S. military moves to integrate AI into warfighting systems raises the risk that stealth Chinese AI could corrupt those mechanisms with malicious code geared to a specific trigger.

“You could have some embedded [military] AI model that is providing almost concierge-like service that then recognizes at some point, ‘Hang on, we’re in a contingency over Taiwan? Let me start giving bad information or slightly adjusting the course of action that I’m proposing to be in China’s favor,’” said Toner.

Then there’s the even bigger contest for humanity’s future.Looming over all this is the question of whether China or the West will develop “superintelligence” first — and what that will mean for civilization itself.

“The race for AI leadership is really two races unfolding at once — once for AI commercialization and another for artificial superintelligence,” said Mark Beall, who directed AI strategy in the Pentagon in the first Trump administration. “A superintelligent system could, in theory, impact strategic stability and potentially rewrite the logic ofmutually assured destruction.”

An ASI piloted by the People’s Liberation Army could allow Beijing to neutralize the U.S. military’s strategic nuclear arsenal — its ultimate war deterrent — and allow China to pursue unchecked aggression across the Taiwan Strait and beyond.

With that comes thethreat of China’s ideology dominating the world— which has worried experts sinceeven before the current AI boom.

A former Pentagon insider outlinedher fears that artificial intelligence could escalate future conflicts into full-blown nuclear warfare, reportsPOLITICO’s Calder McHugh.

Mieke Eoyang, the Biden administration’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, told Calder in an interview that many popular large language models don’t have the guardrails necessary for use in the military context. She warned that autonomous weapons systems known as “killer robots” need guardrails that ensure their decisions aren’t skewed toward unnecessarily escalating conflicts.

“There are [...] concerns with the ‘swarms of killer robots’ people are worried about, which involve escalation management,” she told Calder. “How do you ensure that you’re not engaging in overkill? How do you ensure that the AI is responding in the way that you want?”

An AI system that is poorly calibrated for conflict escalation could have dire consequences for nuclear warfare. Publicly available AI models are often bullish on the use of nukes. “I think one of the challenges that you have with AI models, especially those that are trained on the past opus of humans, is that the tendency toward escalation is a human cognitive bias already,” Eoyang said. “It already happens without AI. So what you’re enabling with AI is for that to come through faster.”

The Paris public prosecutor’s officeopened an investigation into Apple over privacy concerns with its Siri voice assistant, POLITICO’sOcéane Herrero reports.

France’s cybercrime agency is leading the investigation, which comes after a former Apple subcontractor blew the whistle on Siri for collecting recordings of users to improve its responses. The whistleblower alleged the recordings could reveal intimate or confidential information, and identify users.

An Apple spokesperson told POLITICO, “Apple has never used Siri data to create marketing profiles, has never made it available for advertising and has never sold it to anyone for any reason whatsoever.”

China spent the past year pairing cutting-edge battlefield technology with traditional military hardware — all at a pace that risks outstripping the U.S.

The Pentagon will zero in on this buildup in next month’sannual China military power report. The administration’s upcoming National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy will offer an additional picture of America’s response.

Look ahead:The China report is expected to lay out how the People’s Liberation Army is projecting force, moving troops and equipment and operating in regions where the U.S. once assumed it held uncontested advantages. It also arrives amid intensifying questions about whether the Pentagon is keeping its focus on China as it shifts more attention and resourcestoward the Western Hemisphere.

China’s naval expansion includes newamphibious ships with landing decks for dronesand fielded a drone-specific carrier, enabling deployments far afield.

“If your plan was to try to be ready for a Taiwan invasion in 2027, this is the kind of stuff you do in 2025,” saidThomas Shugart, a former submarine warfare officer.

Drowning in drones:No area of China’s military modernization has accelerated more this year thanuncrewed systems. They include large, long-endurance drones, small expendable platforms and a fast-growing effort that mirrors the Pentagon’sdrone “wingman” programfor crewed jets.

The focus underscores Beijing’s embrace of tactics deployed on the battlefield in Ukraine, where low-cost tech stymied larger, more costly weapons systems that are the backbone of the U.S. military arsenal.

“The Russia-Ukraine war is offering extraordinary real-time lessons for what peer-to-peer conflict looks like in the 21st century,” saidAlexander Gray, former chief of staff of the National Security Council in the first Trump administration. “The lessons are sobering in regards to the People’s Republic of China’s modernization and priorities.”

The Pentagon’s ambitious tech and manufacturing ramp-up,recently outlined by U.S. Defense SecretaryPete Hegseth, is an effort to catch up to China.

China is “doubling down on its investments in drones,” saidBecca Wasser, an expert on the U.S. defense industry and strategy. “China’s industrialization and ability to tap into its manufacturing sector for defense needs is above none else at this point, and it’s part of why we see so much of an emphasis on the reindustrialization of America.”

Boat loads of trouble:Beijing’sgrowing navy— which at more than 200 warships is nowthe world’s largest— is boosting China’s strategic edge in regional power projection. Beijing is seemingly gambling that the size of its fleet can outmatch the U.S. Navy’slarger and more technologically advancedwarships.

“Just the sheer number of destroyers, frigate equivalents,future aircraft carriersand submarines makes China’s ship construction program pretty stunning,” said retired Vice Adm.Robert Murrett. “The quantity has a quality of itself, and the quantity that China is looking at is pretty noteworthy.”

The centerpiece of China’s naval buildup in 2025 has been a third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, which entered service earlier this month. The Fujian is two-thirds the size of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier, but like the Ford, it boastsstate-of-the-art electromagnetic catapultsto launch its J-35 and J-15T fighter jets.

“China has made clear that it’s absolutely their intention by mid-century to have what they call a world-class military, and one of the markers of that is carriers,” Shugart said.

Beach barge menace:The PLA’s prep for a possible invasion of Taiwan — which Hegseth said could occuras soon as 2027— also advanced this year. A new military barge system, firstreported by Naval Newsin January, addresses the challenges of beach landings by creating a floating bridge for cargo ships to unload tanks or trucks directly onto the shore.

That eliminates the need for fixed port infrastructure, making the vessels “a logistics enabler for a potential Taiwan crisis,” saidLauren Dickey, former acting director for Taiwan policy at the Pentagon.

Beijing’s military investments are rapidly reversing the traditional calculus of U.S. superiority in a possible conflict with China.

“If you’d asked 10 or 15 years ago how it would go if the Chinese went after the U.S. or Taiwan, I’d have said they’d lose,” Shugart said. “Now I’d say if things keep going the way they’re going for another 10 or 15 more years, it would be pretty certain to go in the other direction.”

China’s grip on core components for military drones is turning into one of the biggest constraints on NATO’s ability to ramp up production for itself and Ukraine, according toa new assessment. The analysis, from the London-based Royal United Services Institute, found that motors, magnets, infrared sensors and battery cells remain overwhelmingly sourced from China in spite of Western efforts to diversify.

Chokepoints:RUSI maps three vital components that Beijing could choke off: rare-earth permanent magnets for electric motors; germanium used in thermal-imaging lenses and lithium-ion battery cells, where China’s output dwarfs every other producer. Even when the drones are assembled in Europe or the U.S., the report says, those components often flow through Chinese suppliers.

The author, RUSI researcherRobert Tollast, said that motors are the first barrier Western companies hit when trying to shift away from China. “Everyone mentions motors,” he said, noting that magnet vendors are facing pressure from their Chinese suppliers, who are asking more pointed questions about to whom their vendors are selling.

Infrared systems aren’t any safer. Tollast described germanium — the mineral used to make the lenses that go into night-vision and targeting cameras — as “the gold standard of infrared lens material.” Prices have spiked five times over the past two years, he said.

Another problem is the batteries to power many drones. China spent years building massive electric-vehicle cell factories, which now gives it control over the price and supply of the battery types used in many drones. Tollast said Chinese drones are so dominant that South Korea’s production is slipping.

No easy answers:While NATO allies are pushing for new drone co-production agreements, the bottlenecks are a big obstacle. Allies are looking at stockpiling magnets and germanium. But stockpiling doesn’t really break dependence, Tollast said.

Breaking China’s stranglehold, he said, is a “multi-year challenge” that will take investments in mining and magnet production — the kind of effort the Pentagon made this year inbuying a 50 percent stake in California-based rare earth miner MP Materials.

Beijing is learning how to squeeze Taiwan without ever firing a shot. And a new war game shows how little it would take to trigger a global crisis.

Participants said the pressure point is Taiwan’s near-total reliance on imported energy and a heavy dependence on liquefied natural gas.

State of play:A freshseries of tabletop exercisesfrom the hawkish Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies sketches out a slow-motion energy siege that Taiwan is not positioned to withstand. The game showed China can bring Taipei to its knees with lawfare, bureaucratic chokepoints and cyber harassment — tactics the players say Beijing is already employing.

“This is the most likely scenario,” said retired Rear Adm.Mark Montgomery, of the think tank. “It’s the one that we think is going on right now.”

He described a “cyber-enabled economic warfare campaign” using diplomatic, economic and administrative tools, all meant to stay “below the level of response” from the U.S. and Japan.

Even a modest disruption of Taiwan’s liquified natural gas supplies, which make up about half of its power mix, would force a wrenching choice between keeping homes lit and keeping chip fabs running. It’s a decision that would trigger a semiconductor world shock.

“Do I keep it as my problem, or do I make it the world’s problem?” Montgomery said. “And I’m with … any other leader of Taiwan that says I need to make this a world problem.”

U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpought to quit trying “carrots” to get Russian PresidentVladimir Putinto the negotiating table and turn to new sanctions to cripple Russian industry, Finnish leaderAlexander Stubbsaid in an interview. “Right now we’re in stick mode,” said Stubb. “The next step should be sanctions — the sanctions package in the [U.S.] Senate.”

DEALS, DEALS, DEALS— In terms of making deals, President Donald Trump’s Asia tour so far looks like a rousing success, with him inking trade agreements with major allies and presiding over a peace pact between Cambodia and Thailand. But the real challenge is still ahead: a bilateral summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In just a few hours, Trump and Xi are scheduled to meet in Gyeongju, South Korea, on the sidelines of this year’s APEC summit, which brings together countries in the Pacific Rim to facilitate open trade.

The meeting with Xi comes at the tail end of afive-day Asia tripthat has helped Trump burnish his reputation as a dealmaker. In Southeast Asia, he’snegotiated new tradeagreements and also secured more access to rare earth and critical minerals in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. During Trump’s visit, Japan similarly pledged toinvest $550 billionin U.S. industry and cooperate in supplying critical minerals. Meanwhile,South Korea has also finalized its trade dealwith Trump: Out of the $350 billion Seoul has pledged to invest in the U.S., it will pay $200 billion in cash in installments, while $150 billion will be used toward investments in the U.S. shipbuilding industry.

Although the actual execution of these trade deals is still in the future, the announcements are enough to help Trump position himself as “someone that can go around the world and make deals that are good for the United States,” said Karl Friedhoff, an East Asia expert at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Don’t expect that same kind of swift dealmaking from the Trump-Xi meeting, though. Both presidents seem dug in, Friedhoff said, and it is unlikely the two will leave the summit landing a deal on anything.

The matters at hand are pressing: Trade tension is high, as both countries have imposed tariffs on each other, with threats to raise them even further next month. The U.S. has said it would consider lowering tariffs if Xi cracks down on the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, despite China saying it has done everything it can to address the issue. China may also be able to negotiate lower tariffs if it relaxes its restrictions on the export of rare earths, as the country accounts for most of the global supply.

China, too, is likely to make its own demands. A key issue raised in the past is the U.S.’s restrictions on importing advanced technology like AI chips. China isn’t the only one pushing for a resumption in sales: chipmaker Nvidia has also been lobbying Trump to allow the company to export its advanced chips to China. And although Trump has publicly said he wants to focus on trade during the meeting, Xi may ask the U.S. to pull back its support for Taiwan.

Luckily for the U.S., Trump’s apparent success in sealing deals with other Asian nations during his trip makes him stronger as he heads into these negotiations, said Shay Wester, the director of Asian economic affairs at the Asia Society.

“It shows China that the U.S. is a force to be reckoned with, not because of the concessions on the tariffs — you know that these countries will pay tariffs — it’s because of them willing to really align with the U.S. on a lot of economic security efforts,” he said.

China, too, however, has experienced changes that make it unlikely to be the same nation that signed the Phase One trade pact with Trump in 2020. Since then, Xi has pushed out his rivals andfully cinched power in China. In this new era, he’s flexing his authority and is unwilling to waver in competition against the U.S., especially as the country’sfive-year economic strategyfocuses on building a self-reliant and resilient economy.

And despite Trump’s many wins in Asia over the last few days, there’s a chance he could be outshone by China. Since Trump has decided to skip APEC’s core “Economic Leaders’ Meeting,” which begins the day after he leaves on Thursday, China will be the largest economy in the room.

“The U.S. leadership is just never present enough in Asia, and when they do that, guess who is generally there? It’s China,” Friedhoff said. “They’re ceding leadership.”

— Meet the Senate aide with a $44,000 taxpayer-funded commute:The top aide to Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansascharged $44,000 to taxpayers over the past two years in commuting expensesbetween Washington and Lynchburg, Virginia, where he lives, according to public records. The reimbursements paid to Brent Robertson are legal and comply with congressional rules governing expense reimbursements, according to experts who reviewed his arrangement, but they also said it was highly unusual and at odds with the intent behind those rules. Typically senior congressional aides are stationed either in Washington or their employer’s home state.

— Hegseth to unveil arms sale overhaul:Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth isplanning to unveil a consequential overhaul of U.S. arms salesthat could reshape how the Pentagon sends weapons to allies and help replenish dwindling stockpiles. Hegseth is expected to announce the changes on Nov. 7 at an unusual gathering of defense industry executives, according to seven people familiar with the planning. The effort is a major test for the novice Defense secretary, whom Vice President JD Vance has called an effective “disrupter.”

— DOJ tried to subpoena an online trans health care provider. A judge quashed it:A federal judge hasdealt a fresh blow to the Trump administration’s attempt to crack down on doctorswho provide gender-affirming care to transgender people. U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead ruled that a wide-ranging subpoena the Justice Department served in June on QueerDoc, a medical practice offering gender-affirming care online, cannot be enforced because the demand was not part of a legitimate law enforcement investigation.

— Vance dodges ‘premature’ talks of 2028 — but keeps options open:Vancebrushed off murmurs of a 2028 presidential runalongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as the early jockeying to succeed President Donald Trump as head of the Republican Party gets underway. In a podcast interview with the New York Post’s “Pod Force One” released Wednesday, Vance dismissed the idea of a presidential bid as “premature” but suggested he’d be open to the plan later in his term.

— ICE quietly furloughed its congressional relations team during shutdown:Immigration and Customs Enforcement hasquietly furloughed most of its congressional relations teamamid the government shutdown, a group of House Democrats alleged in a letter sent to acting ICE chief Todd Lyons on Wednesday. The 15 House Democrats said they now have no clear point of contact to obtain details about detainees and why they have been placed in ICE custody, or information about conditions in detention facilities.

— ICE shake-up will increase arrest numbers. That doesn’t mean there will be more deportations:The Trump administration’sleadership shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcementis likely to boost arrest numbers and fuel its aggressive messaging campaign, but will have little effect on President Donald Trump’s broader goal of rapidly deporting more immigrants, according to five people, including Trump administration officials, people close to the administration and former ICE officials.

TROOPS WITHDRAW— The United States has begundownsizing its military presence in Europe, Romania’s defense ministry confirmed Wednesday.

The Romanian ministry said in a statement that Bucharest and other allies “have been informed about the United States’ decision to downsize American troops in Europe,” describing it as part of a broader reassessment of U.S. global force posture.

ACCESS BLOCKED— The European Parliament isconsidering whether to ban access to Russian websitessuch as Sputnik and RT from its IT infrastructure.

Scores of websites hosting the broadcasters’ content remain accessible despite the EU sanctioning Russian media across the bloc in 2022 after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists, whose Polish and Italian leaders publicly oppose Russia’s war, asked during a political group leaders’ meeting on Oct. 15 for “Russian propaganda websites under EU sanctions” to be made inaccessible on Parliament’s IT infrastructure.

CONSENT CONSIDERED— French lawmakers approved legislation Wednesday thatintroduced the concept of consent in the legal definition of rapefollowing the shocking Gisèle Pelicot trial last year.

While advocates have been pushing for years for France to change the definition of rape and sexual assault to outlaw nonconsensual acts, Pelicot’s case, where 51 men were accused of raping her with the help of her now ex-husband, who had drugged her, gave new impetus to the campaign.

HOT TO GO— Nowadays, you can order anything to your doorstep: groceries, appliances, an ice cream sundae, a martini, an expertly seared Wagyu steak. But take-out is rapidly killing the restaurant industry, or at least drastically shaping it into something anew: less of a physical space to sit and dine, and more of a glorified takeout counter. Last year, nearly 75 percent of restaurant orders weren’t eaten in the restaurant itself.

With help from Danny Nguyen

BE ON THE LOOKOUT:The wait continues for the breakthrough on the U.S.’ effort to score a carveout to Pillar Two.

People closely watching the situation had expected or hoped that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development would release an outline last week laying out how American-based multinationals would get an exemption from the minimum tax half of the global tax deal.

But that failed to materialize, with Estonia acting asonly the most publicof the countries tossing out late objections.

Still, Treasury officials have arguedthere’s no reason for concern— and tax professionals working the issue agree, saying they expect further details out of the OECD as soon as this week.

“If there were fundamental objections, you would’ve expected to hear them earlier,” said Jason Yen of EY, a former Treasury international tax official. “That makes you think these last-minute hiccups will be resolved.”

MORE ON EVERYTHINGin a bit. Thanks for joining us.

It was, in fact, getting hot in there: Today marks 55 years since the Soviet probe Venera 7 became the first spacecraft to land on the surface of Venus after a roughly four-month journey. (Venera 7 survived for some 23 minutes, but did report back that the temperature on Venus was almost 900 degrees Fahrenheit.)

ANXIOUSLY AWAITING:The Trump administration already agreed to the carveout this summer with the G-7, which allowed congressional Republicans to drop the Section 899 provision that would have given the federal government new powers to retaliate against countries using what it perceived to be discriminatory taxes.

GOP tax writers have threatened to roll out a sequel if the Pillar Two exemption doesn’t gain broader approval.

But at the moment, experts are focused more on what they expect from an OECD outline, not the potential fallout if an agreement can’t be reached.

For instance, the core principle undergirding the current talks is that America’s existing minimum tax on domestic multinationals’ foreign profits, first enacted during President Donald Trump’s first term and then modified during this year’s GOP megabill, is robust enough that U.S. companies need not face Pillar Two.

That begs the question of whether a fleshed-out agreement could essentially offer a roadmap to other governments that might want a similar exemption.

Josh Odintz of Holland & Knight argued that other countries also have domestic laws aimed at tamping down corporations’ ability to park profits in low-tax locales.

“Why shouldn’t those countries have the same or equivalent treatment as the U.S.?” said Odintz, another former Treasury tax official, adding that governments would be looking for a potential “path at the OECD for reviewing a country’s system to give them equivalency.”

AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION:To some, Trump’s decision to let Nvidia sell its highly sought-after chips in China — in exchange for the government getting a cut of the profits — looks like a tax and raises revenue like a tax.

But is it actually a tax?, our Brian Faler asks this morning.

Huge corporations aren’t always in the business of embracing tax increases. But Nvidia is fine with handing over 25 percent from its sales of certain chips in China to the federal government, which underscores just how badly the company wants to expand its reach in that market.

The Trump administration has yet to flesh out the details of the plan as well, causing lingering questions of how it might work — not to mention how much it might raise.

And then there’s the question of whether this fee or tax is vulnerable to a legal challenge — that is, if any group out there has standing to sue, given that Nvidia has no issues with what’s happening.

The new policy hasn’t just caused a lot of uncertainty, either. It’s also kind of scrambling how key figures in the various parties are talking about squeezing new revenue out of corporate titans.

Democrats, who are generally on board with higher taxes on big business, argue that this is different — a shakedown rather than a coherent corporate tax policy.

Meanwhile, the Republicans who usually rail against corporate tax increases have had little interest in discussing the administration’s agreement with Nvidia.

NOT GOING TO HAPPEN:A federal judge has rejected an advocacy group’s effort to join a lawsuit that could gut a federal law barring religious groups from endorsing political candidates.

Ina ruling issued late Friday,Judge J. Campbell Barker of the U.S. District Court for Eastern Texas said the group, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, does not have “a direct, legally protectable interest” that would allow it to become a party in the case.

AU opposes a proposed settlement of the lawsuit, under which the IRS would exempt churches and other houses of worship from the ban on endorsing candidates, which stems from a federal law known as the Johnson Amendment. Religious groups that violate the law currently risk losing their tax exemptions.

Under the Biden administration, the IRS had opposed the religious groups’ legal fight against the Johnson Amendment. But Trump is an outspoken foe of the law and his administration joined the groups inproposing the consent judgment in July, prompting AU’s attempt to become a party to the case.

Barker, who Trump nominated for the bench in his first term, noted AU “has already been granted leave to file an amicus brief and participate in oral argument, allowing it to advocate, for its ideological interests.” The group could also move forward with its own litigation in the future, he wrote.

A spokesperson for AU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

VOA News,China boosting development of AI for use in trade war with US,2025-03-12T00:12:00-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-boosting-development-of-ai-for-use-in-trade-war-with-us/8007739.html,"Encouraged by the enthusiastic reception to its DeepSeek artificial intelligence platform in January, China's leaders are going all out to encourage AI companies to harness the power of this technology to compete with the United States and other countries in business and military spheres.

China considers AI an important tool to handle U.S. restrictions on Chinese business, particularly after DeepSeek shook up Wall Street, resulting in a loss of $589 billion for Nvidia stockholders in late January.

""The government in China works directly with the private sector and universities in the advancement and deployment of AI technology and are reducing their dependence on imports of high-technology products,"" said Lourdes Casanova, director of Cornell University's Emerging Markets Institute.

The past few weeks have seen China rolling out several new AI models, including Manus, which experts say can rival the latest model of ChatGPT. Industry experts were more than surprised to find that DeepSeek was equally efficient as ChatGPT, though it used older generation Nvidia chips. The U.S. has banned the supply of advanced chips.

""China and the U.S. have pulled way out front in the AI race. China used to be one to two years behind the U.S. Now, it is likely two to three months,"" Jeffrey Towson, owner of Beijing-based TechMoat Consulting, told VOA.

""Alibaba's Qwen is now a clear leader internationally in LLMs [large language models]. Chinese Kling AI and Minimax are arguably the global leaders in video generation,"" Towson said.

Government involvement

In 2017, China released an AI development program to make the country a world leader by 2030. The government's Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan said that AI would be adopted across different sectors and drive economic transformation.

""China has the most elaborate AI strategy compared to any other country,"" Rogier Creemers, assistant professor in Modern Chinese Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told VOA.

China has established a National Computing Power Grid — somewhat like electricity grids — making it possible for Chinese AI companies to invest less in their own computing power. In the U.S., each company must fend for itself, Creemers said.

Competition

ChatGPT's updated GPT4 large language model has gotten the attention of several top-ranking CEOs of Chinese tech companies. Baidu chief Robin Li recently said his firm was under ""huge pressure and a sense of crisis"" after seeing the updated ChatGPT. Baidu, which has launched Ernie Bot, said ""the gap [between China] and leading international levels [in the field] has widened.""

""AI plus robotics is likely where China will take a commanding lead over the U.S., just like in EVs,” Towson said. “Chinese companies like Unitree are already pulling ahead. Watch for China to surprise everyone in personalized robots, industrial robots and speciality robots,” he said.

Communist Party control

Chinese President Xi Jinping recently convened a meeting with heads of private companies, including tech firms, calling on them to ""show your talent"" in overcoming challenges such as an economic slowdown and U.S. restrictions on Chinese business.

""There are discussions that the growth of large language models — the technology behind chatbots like DeepSeek and ChatGPT — may be hindered by media censorship, because the models will have less diverse data to work with,"" said Creemers.

On the other hand, the government's control ensures industrial policy coordination, which is helpful in the growth of AI in China.

China is focusing more on specialized software for health and other industries, which can largely tolerate political censorship. Chinese AI models are improving diagnostic accuracy in diverse areas from detecting rib fractures to cancer.

US ban on advanced chips

""It will take some time, but it would not be a surprise if China is also soon capable of building advanced chips for AI,"" Cornell’s Casanova said.

Companies such as Huawei have shown that they can design and manufacture advanced chips successfully, thereby overcoming restrictions imposed by the U.S., she said.

Towson said China is 100% dedicated to building an independent semiconductor supply chain.

""It is advancing faster than anyone thought possible. But the frontier is always advancing, and it's unclear how this will play out over time,"" he said.

""But you can do a lot with software,” Creemers said. “China can work with more chips with less computing power or with fewer sophisticated chips.""

The risk for China is not limited to chips, because the Trump administration could impose restrictions on the Chinese AI model. It could also react to China’s restriction on the use of ChatGPT, because it can violate its censorship rules.

AI and the military

China's air force is using AI-powered biometric tests to screen potential pilots as part of a rigorous hiring process, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

""AI now plays a crucial role in interpreting candidates' biological signals, revealing underlying health risks that might not be immediately apparent to human evaluators,"" CCTV said. ""This data-driven approach allows the air force to predict long-term risks, ultimately ensuring that only the most suitable candidates are chosen.""

Chinese researchers have also revealed that the Chinese army has been using Meta's publicly available Llama model to develop an AI tool for potential military applications."
VOA News,"China's DeepSeek AI rattles Wall Street, but questions remain",2025-01-27T20:42:45-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-deepseek-ai-rattles-wall-street-but-questions-remain-/7952661.html,"Chinese researchers backed by a Hangzhou-based hedge fund recently released a new version of a large language model (LLM) called DeepSeek-R1 that rivals the capabilities of the most advanced U.S.-built products but reportedly does so with fewer computing resources and at much lower cost.

High Flyer, the hedge fund that backs DeepSeek, said that the model nearly matches the performance of LLMs built by U.S. firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta, but does so using only about 2,000 older generation computer chips manufactured by U.S.-based industry leader Nvidia while costing only about $6 million worth of computing power to train.

By comparison, Meta’s AI system, Llama, uses about 16,000 chips, and reportedly costs Meta vastly more money to train.

Open-source model

The apparent advance in Chinese AI capabilities comes after years of efforts by the U.S. government to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors and the equipment used to manufacture them. Over the past two years, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. put multiple export control measures in place with the specific aim of throttling China’s progress on AI development.

DeepSeek appears to have innovated its way to some of its success, developing new and more efficient algorithms that allow the chips in the system to communicate with each other more effectively, thereby improving performance.

At least some of what DeepSeek R1’s developers did to improve its performance is visible to observers outside the company, because the model is open source, meaning that the algorithms it uses to answer queries are public.

Market reaction

The news about DeepSeek’s capabilities sparked a broad sell-off of technology stocks on U.S. markets on Monday, as investors began to question whether U.S. companies’ well-publicized plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data centers and other infrastructure would preserve their dominance in the field. When the markets closed on Monday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down by 3.1%, and Nvidia’s share price had plummeted by nearly 17%.

However, not all AI experts believe the markets’ reaction to the release of DeepSeek R1 is justified, or that the claims about the model’s development should be taken at face value.

Mel Morris, CEO of U.K.-based Corpora.ai, an AI research engine, told VOA that while DeepSeek is an impressive piece of technology, he believes the market reaction has been excessive and that more information is needed to accurately judge the impact DeepSeek will have on the AI market.

“There's always an overreaction to things, and there is today, so let's just step back and analyze what we're seeing here,” Morris said. “Firstly, we have no real understanding of exactly what the cost was or the time scale involved in building this product. We just don't know. … They claim that it's significantly cheaper and more efficient, but we have no proof of that.”

Morris said that while DeepSeek’s performance may be comparable to that of OpenAI products, “I've not seen anything yet that convinces me that they've actually cracked the quantum step in the cost of operating these sorts of models.”

Doubts about origins

Lennart Heim, a data scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA that while it is plain that DeepSeek R1 benefits from innovative algorithms that boost its performance, he agreed that the general public actually knows relatively little about how the underlying technology was developed.

Heim said that it is unclear whether the $6 million training cost cited by High Flyer actually covers the whole of the company’s expenditures — including personnel, training data costs and other factors — or is just an estimate of what a final training “run” would have cost in terms of raw computing power. If the latter, Heim said, the figure is comparable to the costs incurred by better U.S. models.

He also questioned the assertion that DeepSeek was developed with only 2,000 chips. In a blog post written over the weekend, he noted that the company is believed to have existing operations with tens of thousands of Nvidia chips that could have been used to do the work necessary to develop a model that is capable of running on just 2,000.

“This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving their models to customers,” he wrote.

He also pointed out that the company’s decision to release version R1 of its LLM last week — on the heels of the inauguration of a new U.S. president — appeared political in nature. He said that it was “clearly intended to rattle the public’s confidence in the United States’ AI leadership during a pivotal moment in U.S. policy.”

Dean W. Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, was also cautious about declaring that DeepSeek R1 has somehow upended the AI landscape.

“I think Silicon Valley and Wall Street are overreacting to some extent,” he told VOA. “But at the end of the day, R1 means that the competition between the U.S. and China is likely to remain fierce, and that we need to take it seriously.”

Export control debate

The apparent success of DeepSeek has been used as evidence by some experts to suggest that the export controls put in place under the Biden administration may not have had the intended effects.

“At a minimum, this suggests that U.S. approaches to AI and export controls may not be as effective as proponents claim,” Paul Triolo, a partner with DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told VOA.

“The availability of very good but not cutting-edge GPUs — for example, that a company like DeepSeek can optimize for specific training and inference workloads — suggests that the focus of export controls on the most advanced hardware and models may be misplaced,” Triolo said. “That said, it remains unclear how DeepSeek will be able to keep pace with global leaders such as OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, Meta and others that will continue to have access to the best hardware systems.”

Other experts, however, argued that export controls have simply not been in place long enough to show results.

Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown’s University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology told VOA that it would be “very premature” to call the measures a failure.

“The CEO of DeepSeek has gone on record saying the biggest constraint they face is access to high-level compute resources,” Bresnick said. “If [DeepSeek] had as much compute at their fingertips as Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, etc, there would be a significant boost in their performance. So … I don't think that DeepSeek is the smoking gun that some people are claiming it is [to show that export controls] do not work.”

Bresnick noted that the toughest export controls were imposed in only 2023, meaning that their effects may just be starting to be felt. He said that the real test of their effectiveness will be whether U.S. firms are able to continue to outpace China in coming years.

The larger group of companies is made up primarily of firms active in defense contracting and includes Lockheed Martin and five of its subsidiaries; General Dynamics and three of its subsidiaries; three subsidiaries of Raytheon; one subsidiary of Boeing; and more than a dozen other companies.

Chinese companies are immediately barred from selling ""dual-use"" items — goods that may have a military purpose in addition to civilian applications — to any of the named companies.

In an announcement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the sanctions were put in place ""in order to safeguard national security … interests and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation.""

Negligible impact

Experts pointed out that because U.S. defense contractors don't typically do business with the country's major adversaries, the new restrictions would likely have little impact on the companies named by China.

""Short answer is, this won't have much, if any effect, on those companies: They didn't do business with China anyway,"" Raymond Kuo, a director and senior political scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA. He said that move would also have no noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy.

However, he added, the sanctions do illustrate that China is determined to respond when the U.S. applies sanctions in the other direction, as the Biden administration has done several times in recent months.

""It does show that the Chinese are willing to go kind of tit for tat with the United States,"" Kuo said. ""If we increase our levels of trade sanctions — and [President-elect Donald] Trump has threatened 60% tariffs across the board — that they can hit back in a whole variety of ways.""

'Unreliable' entities

In a second announcement, the Ministry of Commerce added 10 of the companies from the first announcement, all subsidiaries of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon, to its list of ""unreliable entities,"" a designation that entails a much stricter set of sanctions.

The companies are prohibited from importing or exporting goods to and from China and from making new investments there. In addition, executives of the companies are barred from traveling to China, and any work or residency permits they currently have are revoked.

The Ministry of Commerce said that all of the companies designated as unreliable have sold arms to Taiwan, the democratically self-governing island that China claims as its own territory. It said the new restrictions were meant to ""safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.""

The additions to the unreliable entities list come just a week after Beijing, on December 27, announced an earlier round of sanctions targeting U.S. firms and their executives for selling arms to Taiwan. The companies named included subsidiaries of Raytheon and Boeing.

In a statement emailed to VOA, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said it was determined that the 28 companies facing export controls ""endanger China's national security.""

He also said, ""The Chinese government will continue to unswervingly promote high-level opening up, firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of various business entities, and promote the development of compliant trade.""

Follows other sanctions

Thursday's announcement follows other recent actions by Beijing cracking down on trade with the U.S., often in response to U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses.

In early December, the Biden administration announced a ban on the sale to Chinese firms of cutting-edge equipment used to make the world's most advanced semiconductors as well as high-bandwidth memory products needed to maximize those chips' efficiency. At the same time, the U.S. added 140 Chinese companies to a list of entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing business with.

In response, China imposed new restrictions on the sale of ""rare earth"" minerals to the United States. China dominates the world market for minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, which are key components in various high-tech products from smartphones to missile guidance systems.

Little more than a month earlier, the Biden administration had finalized a new set of rules on outbound U.S. investments in China.

The rule codified a set of restrictions barring U.S. individuals and firms from investing in certain kinds of business ventures in China. Among the areas affected are the manufacture of advanced semiconductors and microelectronics, technology used in quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems."
VOA News,EU approves $960 million in German aid for Infineon chips plant,2025-02-20T05:49:18-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-approves-960-million-in-german-aid-for-infineon-chips-plant/7981638.html,"The European Commission said Thursday it had approved 920 million-euro of German state aid, or $960 million, to Infineon Technologies for the construction of a new semiconductor manufacturing plant in Dresden.

The measure will allow Infineon to complete the MEGAFAB-DD project, which will be able to produce a wide range of different types of computer chips, the Commission said.

Chipmakers across the globe are pouring billions of dollars into new plants, as they take advantage of generous subsidies from the United States and the EU to keep the West ahead of China in developing cutting-edge semiconductor technology.

The European Commission has earmarked 15 billion euros for public and private semiconductor projects by 2030.

""This new manufacturing plant will bring flexible production capacity to the EU and thereby strengthen Europe's security of supply, resilience and technological autonomy in semiconductor technologies, in line with the objectives set out in the European Chips Act,"" the Commission said in a statement.

The Commission said the plant -- which is slated to reach full capacity in 2031 -- will be a front-end facility, covering wafer processing, testing and separation, adding that its chips will be used in industrial, automotive and consumer applications.

The aid will take the form of a direct grant of up to 920 million euros to Infineon to support its overall investment, amounting to 3.5 billion euros. Infineon, Germany’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, which was spun off from Siemens 25 years ago, has said the plant will be the largest single investment in its history.

Infineon has agreed with the EU to ensure the project will bring wider positive effects to the EU semiconductor value chain and invest in the research and development of the next generation of chips in Europe, the Commission said.

It will also contribute to crisis preparedness by committing to implement priority-rated orders in the case of a supply shortage, in line with the European Chips Act."
VOA News,"Taiwan chipmaker starts making 4-nanometer chips in US, official says",2025-01-10T20:10:15-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-chipmaker-starts-making-4-nanometer-chips-in-us-official-says/7933080.html,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips in Arizona for U.S. customers, a milestone in the Biden administration's semiconductor efforts, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters.

In November, the Commerce Department finalized a $6.6 billion grant to TSMC's U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona.

""For the first time ever in our country's history, we are making leading-edge 4-nanometer chips on American soil, American workers — on par in yield and quality with Taiwan,"" Raimondo told Reuters in an interview, saying it had begun in recent weeks.

""That's a big deal — never been done before, never in our history. And lots of people said it couldn't happen,"" Raimondo said of the previously undisclosed production start.

A spokesperson for TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple and Nvidia, which reports earnings next week, declined to comment Friday.

In April, TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona production facility by 2030.

Congress created a $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program in 2022. Commerce persuaded all five leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate production facilities in the United States as part of the program.

Raimondo told Reuters earlier that Commerce had to persuade TSMC to boost its U.S. plans.""It didn't happen on its own. ... We had to convince TSMC that they would want to expand,"" Raimondo said.

TSMC will produce the world's most advanced 2-nanometer technology at its second Arizona factory, expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology, called ""A16,"" in Arizona.

The TSMC award from Commerce also includes up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans.

Raimondo wants the United States to make 20% of world's leading-edge logic chips by 2030 — up from the 0% before TSMC began production in Arizona.

In April, Commerce said TSMC expects to begin high-volume production in its first U.S. fab by the first half of 2025.

Last month, Commerce finalized an award of $407 million to help fund Amkor Technology's planned $2 billion advanced semiconductor packaging facility in Arizona, which is set to be the largest of its kind in the U.S.

When fully operational, Amkor's Arizona plant will package and test millions of chips for autonomous vehicles, 5G/6G and data centers. Apple will be its first and largest customer, with the chips produced at a nearby TSMC facility."
VOA News,"Trump, Taiwanese chipmaker announce new $100 billion plan to build five new US factories",2025-03-03T16:51:16-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taiwanese-chipmaker-announce-new-100-billion-plan-to-build-five-new-us-factories-/7995845.html,"Chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced on Monday plans to make an additional $100 billion investment in the United States and build five additional chips factories in the coming years.

TSMC CEO C.C. Wei announced the plan in a meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump.

""We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here,"" Trump said. ""It's a matter of national security for us.""

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a leading supplier to major U.S. hardware manufacturers.

The $100 billion outlay, which would boost domestic production and make the United States less reliant on semiconductors made in Asia, is in addition to a major prior investment announcement. TSMC agreed in April to expand its planned U.S. investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona factory by 2030.

With his Nov. 5 election victory largely driven by voters' economic concerns, Trump has stepped up efforts to bolster investments in domestic industries to create jobs.

The TSMC announcement is the latest in a string of such developments. In February, Apple said it would invest $500 billion in the next four years. Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani and SoftBank also have promised multibillion-dollar investments in the U.S.

TSMC said on Monday it looks ""forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers.""

The U.S. Commerce Department under then President Joe Biden finalized a $6.6 billion government subsidy in November for TSMC's U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona.

Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act legislation in 2022 to provide $52.7 billion in subsidies for American semiconductor production and research.

Taiwan's dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cellphones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up pressure to assert its sovereignty claims.

China claims Taiwan as its territory, but the democratically elected government in Taipei rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

Under Biden, the Commerce Department convinced all five leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate factories in the U.S. as part of the program to address national security risks from imported chips.

Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers last month that the program was ""an excellent down payment"" to rebuild the sector, but he has declined to commit grants that have already been approved by the department, saying he wanted to ""read them and analyze them and understand them.""

A TSMC spokesperson said last month the company had received $1.5 billion in CHIPS Act money before the new administration came in as per the milestone terms of its agreement.

TSMC last year agreed to produce the world's most advanced 2-nanometer technology at its second Arizona factory expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology called ""A16"" in Arizona.

TSMC has already begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers in Arizona.

The TSMC award included up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans."
VOA News,US imposes export controls on biotech equipment over AI security concerns,2025-01-15T15:40:07-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-export-controls-on-biotech-equipment-over-ai-security-concerns/7938147.html,"On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data science.

The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech equipment’s technology to bolster its military capabilities and help design new weapons using artificial intelligence.

The department said the technology has many applications, including its ability to be used for ""human performance enhancement, brain-machine interfaces, biologically inspired synthetic materials and possibly biological weapons.""

The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to countries without a U.S. license, such as China.

The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can “generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and biological design tools.""

Last week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Beijing ""firmly opposes any country's development, possession or use of biological weapons.""

This latest move by the United States follows recent policy decisions that reflect Washington’s broad aim to limit Beijing’s access to U.S. technology and data.

Washington announced on Monday that it would tighten Beijing’s access to AI chip and technology exports by implementing new regulations that cap the number of chips that can be exported to certain countries, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

This month, the ban on popular Chinese-owned social media TikTok is planned to go into effect due to U.S. concerns over its potential to share sensitive data with China’s government."

VOA News,Why did US exclude India from unrestricted access to AI chips?,2025-01-14T22:57:54-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/why-did-the-us-exclude-india-from-unrestricted-access-to-ai-chips-/7936974.html,"U.S. President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday an executive order to boost development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in America. A day earlier, his administration announced sweeping measures to block access to the most advanced semiconductors by China and other adversaries.

But the U.S. left India, its strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific, off a list of 18 countries that are allowed unrestricted access to advanced AI chips. Analysts say while a growing technological relationship between the two countries would likely make India eligible in the future to access advanced U.S. AI chips, New Delhi's existing ties with Moscow and the perception of a less robust technology regulatory framework led to its exclusion from the top list.

Exclusion not a surprise

The Commerce Department's policy framework divides the world into three categories. The first tier includes the U.S. and 18 countries with unrestricted access, followed by a list of more than 100 countries that will be subjected to new caps on advanced semiconductors with individual exemptions. The third tier includes adversaries such as China and Russia that face maximum restrictions.

India falls in the second category, along with U.S. allies like Israel and close friends such as Singapore.

Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that India's relationship with Russia ""puts it outside a super safe category.""

India has had close ties with Russia since the Soviet Union supported its desire for independence from Britain. It maintained those ties during the Cold War, when the U.S. sided with India's rival Pakistan.

Scott Jones, a non-resident fellow at Washington's Stimson Center think tank, highlighted recent reports that accused a few Indian companies of aiding Russia's war on Ukraine, but stressed that while being excluded is a disappointment, it's ""not a setback for India.""

He also pointed to the perception that ""India's ability to control and manage technology is perhaps not as robust as evidenced in some of the 18 countries.""

While India may be off the unrestricted list for now, analysts say its growing technological cooperation with the U.S. may shield it from some curbs.

Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chair on India and Emerging Asia Economies at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the presence of caveats in the new framework would ensure India's later participation.

""The fact that they have announced that there will be a pathway for some countries to get exemptions that are above what they're going to consider the standard cap, India, I imagine, would be on the short list of countries,"" he told VOA.

In early January, national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior officials. During the trip, both sides reiterated their commitment to forge a ""strategic technology partnership"" and strengthen cooperation under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), a bilateral mechanism focused on technology partnership.

On semiconductors, the U.S. is facilitating investments in India's semiconductor manufacturing and intensifying R&D collaboration.

During his trip, Sullivan highlighted the investment of $2.7 billion in India by U.S. chipmaker Micron to create semiconductor packaging facilities, which he hoped would contribute to establishing ""India as a new hub in the global chip ecosystem.""

The Indian government too is investing billions of dollars through its dedicated program called the India Semiconductor Mission and Production Linked Incentive scheme.

Rossow argued that the Indian government would not have been ""terribly surprised"" that ""they were not included"" in the list.

Jones of the Stimson Center agreed.

""Jake Sullivan was in New Delhi last week, and I would be very surprised if he did not inform his Indian counterparts of what was going to happen,"" he said.

Ensuring America's leadership in AI

The Biden administration has focused on the centrality of artificial intelligence to America's security and economic strength. According to a White House factsheet, the latest steps are part of its effort to prevent offshoring this critical technology and ensure that ""the world's AI runs on American rails.""

Since October 2022, the U.S. government has enacted a series of export controls, blocking access of advanced semiconductors to China to prevent its use for military applications. While initially the measures adversely affected the Chinese semiconductor industry, Beijing has continued to advance its capabilities and is attempting to narrow the technology gap.

According to Chakravorti of the Fletcher School, there are numerous implementation challenges of this expansive global strategy.

""From lobbying from the U.S. chipmakers that will start as soon as Trump takes office to potential leaks in the carefully calibrated list of countries. Will there be a secondary market? How does this affect where future data centers are built?"" he asked.

Jones of the Stimson Center argued that the policy is more a ""symbolic gesture than a practical consideration"" but has a stern message for the rest of the world.

""The U.S. is clearly saying, if you want to participate in the U.S.-sponsored AI ecosystem, you have to pick now. You pick China or you pick us. You can't have it both ways. You can't play one off against the other. You have to choose,"" he concluded."
VOA News,Biden issues executive order for building AI data centers on federal land,2025-01-14T07:15:01-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-unveils-new-rules-for-ai-chip-model-exports-/7934695.html,"U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order Tuesday directing the development of artificial intelligence data centers on six federal land sites, with a special focus on powering them with clean energy and upholding high labor standards.

Biden said in a statement that the United States is the world leader in AI, but cannot take that lead for granted.

“We will not let America be out-built when it comes to the technology that will define the future, nor should we sacrifice critical environmental standards and our shared efforts to protect clean air and clean water,” Biden said.

The order calls for the Department of Defense and Department of Energy to each identify three suitable sites where private companies will lease the land, pay for the construction and operation of the data centers and ensure the supply of enough clean energy to fully power the sites.

The developers will also have to buy “an appropriate share” of semiconductors produced in the United States to help ensure there is a “robust domestic semiconductor supply chain,” the White House said.

In addition to identifying the sites, the federal government will also commit under the order to expedite the permitting process for the data center construction.

Senior administration officials, in a phone call with journalists previewing the order, highlighted the national security need for the United States to have its own powerful AI infrastructure, both to protect it for its own use but also to prevent adversaries such as China from possessing those capabilities.

“From the national security standpoint, it's really critical to find a pathway for building the data centers and power infrastructure to support frontier AI operations here in the United States to ensure that the most powerful AI models continue to be trained and stored securely here in the United States,” an official said.

A senior administration official cited the priority of making sure the AI industry had an anchor in the United States to avoid repeating the history of other technologies that moved offshore to areas with lower labor and environmental standards as well.

AI chip restrictions

Tuesday’s order comes a day after the Biden administration announced new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the interactions of users with AI systems.

The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments, comes in response to what administration officials described as a need to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging technology in order to promote innovation.

“Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every business application in every industry around the world, with enormous potential for enhanced productivity and societal, health care and economic benefits,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters. “That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense.”

A senior administration official said the new rule will not include any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom or the United States.

The rules build on 2023 curbs limiting the export of certain AI chips to China, a strategic competitor in the production of advanced semiconductors. Beijing attacked the new U.S. AI edict as a ""flagrant violation"" of international trade rules.

China’s Ministry of Commerce said the Biden administration announcement ""is another example of the generalization of the concept of national security and the abuse of export control, and a flagrant violation of international multilateral economic and trade rules.""

Beijing said it would ""take necessary measures to firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""

Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of the most powerful closed weight AI models.

The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using to make its decisions.

Most countries — those not included in the closed partner or arms embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available, nor for any less advanced chips.

Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems, provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior administration official said."

Other private business leaders who attended the symposium included Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Xiaomi's Lei Jun, BYD's Wang Chuanfu, Unitree's Wang Xingxing, and CATL's Robin Zeng, a video published by CCTV showed.

Meituan's Wang Xing, China Feihe's Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong also attended, the video showed.

Tencent's Pony Ma was also there, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the meeting details were not public. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Xi delivered a speech after listening to representatives of private companies, official news agency Xinhua said. The report did not provide any details about the symposium, held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment on Monday that would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma.

The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally amid an intensifying China-U.S. technology war, the sources had said.

The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets.

Xi has long stressed the need for China to achieve self-sufficiency in semiconductors and wants the country to use AI to drive economic development.

But China's efforts have been hampered by export control measures on chips imposed by Washington which is worried Beijing could use advanced semiconductors to boost its military capabilities.

""It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the U.S.,"" said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong.

""The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the U.S.""

Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.

""Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the U.S.,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis.

""Still, the regulatory environment is the black box. As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now."""
VOA News,Russia turns to China to step up AI race against US,2025-01-09T21:21:42-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-turns-to-china-to-step-up-ai-race-against-us/7931829.html,"Russia's efforts to obtain China's help in enhancing artificial intelligence is seen as a bid to challenge America's lead in the field even as the outgoing Biden administration is expected to impose new export control measures to further curb Beijing's access to AI chips.

As the new year began, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's state-owned Sberbank, to work with China in researching and developing AI technology, according to the Kremlin.

""The Russian president sees his country in global competition for AI with the United States and has positioned the state resources to try and compete with the U.S. in information and cyberspace – two areas where artificial intelligence is supposed to aid Russia in what they see as Western narratives and influence,"" said Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

Moscow views Beijing's success in AI as an example to follow, and its ""cooperation with China is viewed as a necessary step towards acquiring artificial intelligence-related skill sets, knowledge and technology,"" Bendett told VOA in written comments.

The U.S. currently leads in AI innovation, followed by China, which is falling behind by wide margins, according to a November report by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Russia ranks 31st out of 83 countries in AI implementation, innovation and investment, according to U.K.-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index.

Response to sanctions

Western sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have limited the country's AI development, and Moscow has turned to Beijing to offset the restriction, according to Bendett in his report ""The Role of AI in Russia's Confrontation with the West.""

Sberbank, which Putin instructed to collaborate with China, is under Western sanctions.

It is Russia's largest bank and leads the country's AI development efforts.

The outgoing Biden administration is expected to impose a new set of export control measures aimed at further limiting China's ability to access chips that support AI technology. The new measures could come as early as Friday, according to Bloomberg.

Sberbank CEO German Gref said in 2023 that Russia cannot obtain graphics processing units, microchips needed to support AI development, according to Reuters.

But the bank's first deputy CEO, Alexander Vedyakhin, said in December that despite Western sanctions, Russia can improve its AI ranking by 2030 through its own development.

Another key area where Russia has sought to further apply AI help from China is in the military.

""There already have been top level meetings between Russia and Chinese militaries in 2024,"" and ""ongoing dialogue"" between the defense ministries of the two countries is likely so they can understand ""how AI could aid in a large-scale conventional conflict, like the one unfolding in Ukraine,"" Bendett said.

Russian and Chinese officials met in Beijing early last year to discuss military application of AI, especially in developing autonomous weapons, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry.

AI-powered weapons

In December, Ukraine said Russia began using AI-powered strike drones with improved capabilities that can evade air defenses, identify key targets and operate offline.

James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Russia is likely to use AI technology on enhancing drones as well as in making weapons with improved target detection and attack speed.

The China-Russia AI partnership ""creates new risk for the U.S.,"" but military application of ""AI won't compensate for bad strategy"" in the battlefield, he said.

Attending an AI conference in Moscow last month, Song Haitao, president of the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, said China plans to sign an agreement with Russia's Sberbank to promote bilateral cooperation on AI development.

Speaking at the conference, Putin applauded China for ""making great strides"" in advancing AI technology and its application, including in building ""smart cities"" and conducting ""modern governance.""

Sam Bresnick, research fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said although it is not entirely clear how Beijing might benefit from helping Moscow in developing AI, China might want some military technologies and wartime data from Russia in return.

""Russia is very good at making submarines, and there's been a speculation in the past that China could benefit from acquiring that kind of technology. Another one is helicopter technology,"" Bresnick said.

""The war in Ukraine has generated an astonishing amount of data,"" Bresnick continued. ""China would probably be interested in getting its hands on them because having more militarily relevant data from Russia would help China develop its own AI systems for military.""

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Thursday that ""in terms of the application of artificial intelligence, China actively advocates the principles of 'people-oriented' and 'intelligent for good,' ensuring that artificial intelligence is safe, reliable and controllable, better enabling global sustainable development, and enhancing the common well-being of all mankind."""
VOA News,"Taiwan chipmaker starts making 4-nanometer chips in US, official says",2025-01-10T20:10:15-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-chipmaker-starts-making-4-nanometer-chips-in-us-official-says/7933080.html,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips in Arizona for U.S. customers, a milestone in the Biden administration's semiconductor efforts, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters.

In November, the Commerce Department finalized a $6.6 billion grant to TSMC's U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona.

""For the first time ever in our country's history, we are making leading-edge 4-nanometer chips on American soil, American workers — on par in yield and quality with Taiwan,"" Raimondo told Reuters in an interview, saying it had begun in recent weeks.

""That's a big deal — never been done before, never in our history. And lots of people said it couldn't happen,"" Raimondo said of the previously undisclosed production start.

A spokesperson for TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple and Nvidia, which reports earnings next week, declined to comment Friday.

In April, TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona production facility by 2030.

Congress created a $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program in 2022. Commerce persuaded all five leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate production facilities in the United States as part of the program.

Raimondo told Reuters earlier that Commerce had to persuade TSMC to boost its U.S. plans.""It didn't happen on its own. ... We had to convince TSMC that they would want to expand,"" Raimondo said.

TSMC will produce the world's most advanced 2-nanometer technology at its second Arizona factory, expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology, called ""A16,"" in Arizona.

The TSMC award from Commerce also includes up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans.

Raimondo wants the United States to make 20% of world's leading-edge logic chips by 2030 — up from the 0% before TSMC began production in Arizona.

In April, Commerce said TSMC expects to begin high-volume production in its first U.S. fab by the first half of 2025.

Last month, Commerce finalized an award of $407 million to help fund Amkor Technology's planned $2 billion advanced semiconductor packaging facility in Arizona, which is set to be the largest of its kind in the U.S.

When fully operational, Amkor's Arizona plant will package and test millions of chips for autonomous vehicles, 5G/6G and data centers. Apple will be its first and largest customer, with the chips produced at a nearby TSMC facility."
VOA News,Taiwan lauds TSMC investment as 'historic moment' for US relations,2025-03-06T12:24:37-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-lauds-tsmc-investment-as-historic-moment-for-relations-with-us/8001263.html,"Taiwan President Lai Ching-te is hailing a planned $100 billion investment in the U.S. by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation as “a historic moment for U.S-Taiwan relations,” adding that the move is not the result of pressure imposed by the U.S. government.

The president and TSMC chairman C.C. Wei spoke to reporters at Taiwan’s presidential office in Taipei Thursday afternoon. Wei said the chipmaker's latest U.S. expansion was driven by large customer demand, adding that its production lines there are already “fully booked” for the next three years.

“Whenever TSMC builds a production line in any location outside Taiwan, it is always driven by customer demand,” he said.

The $100 billion investment — which is separate from an investment of up to $65 billion in the U.S. that TSMC agreed to last April — calls for the construction of three new chip plants, two chip-packaging facilities and a research and development center in the western U.S. state of Arizona.

The president’s remarks come two days after Wei and U.S. President Donald Trump stood in the White House and announced the chip giant’s expansion.

""We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here,"" Trump said during the press conference, adding that the move is “a matter of national security” for the U.S.

Wei said Thursday that TSMC also plans to build 11 new production lines in Taiwan this year, and the expansion in the U.S. won’t affect that timeline.

“We will continue to build production lines in Taiwan, and I have asked President Lai to help TSMC find new lands to build facilities,” he said.

TSMC has also built new facilities in Japan and Germany in recent years, a move that Lai said helps other Taiwanese businesses engage in international cooperation and increases Taiwan’s strength.

TSMC’s global expansion shows that “Taiwan’s industries have been moving westward, southward, and northward, and the strength that the industries have accumulated over the last few decades has helped Taiwan to confidently cross the Pacific Ocean and expand eastward to the American continent,” President Lai said during Thursday’s press conference.

Opposition not pleased

Despite the reassurances from Wei and Lai, TSMC’s expansion in the U.S. has prompted widespread concerns in Taiwan, withsome opposition lawmakerssaying TSMC’s expansion in the U.S. could hurt the island’s semiconductor industry and national security.

Fu Kun-chi, the legislative caucus whip from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang, or KMT, told journalists on Tuesday that TSMC’s additional investment in the U.S. could leave the island with “nothing to safeguard” if China militarily attacks Taiwan since Washington would possess the most advanced chip manufacturing processes.

Additionally, former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also with the KMT, has accused Lai of “selling” TSMC to the United States.

“Taiwanese people worry ‘the protector of the nation’ is going to move away and this is a major national security crisis that will have a major negative impact on Taiwanese people’s confidence, cross-strait relations and Taiwan’s geopolitical position in the future,” Ma wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

Analysts say the opposition party’s rhetoric is part of its strategy to raise questions about U.S.-Taiwan relations.

“TSMC has been expanding their operations for quite some time, including in Japan and China, but the discourse of TSMC abandoning Taiwan only surfaces when the focus is on TSMC’s expansion in the U.S.,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University.

“This is a sign that the discourse is more about trying to spread American skepticism than it is a genuine critique about TSMC and its intentions,” he told VOA by phone.

Other experts say that while the Taiwanese government is trying to counter the opposition party’s criticism by hosting a press conference on Thursday, the KMT’s arguments are raising doubts for some.

“Their efforts have achieved the intended goal because there is too much information for people unfamiliar with TSMC’s operations outside of Taiwan to comprehend,” said Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan.

“Even when TSMC completes all its overseas facilities by 2030, more than 80% of its productions will still remain in Taiwan, meaning that its overseas expansion won’t really affect Taiwan that much,” he told VOA by phone.

Defense spending still in question

Trump has repeatedly claimed that Taiwan has stolen semiconductor technologies from the U.S., Nachman said TSMC’s expansion in Arizona can help reduce potential friction between Taipei and Washington.

The additional investment “helps to assure the Trump administration that Taiwan is serious about doing what it takes to be friends with America,” he told VOA.

Despite this positive effect, Chen and Nachman both say Taiwan still faces pressure from the Trump administration to significantly increase its defense budget.

“Taiwan shouldn’t be celebrating because we saw Elbridge Colby echoing Trump’s sentiment during his Senate confirmation hearing that Taiwan needs to spend 10% of its GDP on defense,” said Nachman, adding that the Taiwanese government will feel a lot of pressure from Washington once Taiwan’s national defense comes back onto Trump’s radar.

To address the looming challenges, Chen said the Taiwanese government should demonstrate its willingness to purchase more weapons from the U.S. or lay out plans to deepen defense-related cooperation with Washington.

“Taiwan needs to show its determination to enhance its defense capabilities, and it needs to put forward some concrete numbers,” he told VOA."
VOA News,Taiwan pledges chip talks and investment in bid to ease Trump’s concerns,2025-02-14T08:50:24-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-pledges-chip-talks-and-investment-in-bid-to-ease-trump-s-concerns-/7974979.html,"Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged on Friday to talk with the United States about President Donald Trump’s concerns over the chip industry and to increase U.S. investment and buy more from the country, while also spending more on defense.

Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he aimed to restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and repeating claims about Taiwan having taken away the industry he wanted back in the United States.

Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the National Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said that the global semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in which the division of work among various countries is important.

""We of course are aware of President Trump's concerns,"" Lai said.

""Taiwan's government will communicate and discuss with the semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we will come up with good proposals and engage in further discussions with the United States,"" he added.

Democratic countries including the United States should come together to build a global alliance for AI chips and a ""democratic supply chain"" for advanced chips, Lai said.

""While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors, we also see it as Taiwan's responsibility to contribute to the prosperity of the international community.""

Taiwan is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, and a crucial part of the developing AI industry.

TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump's first administration.

TSMC's Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday, underperforming the broader market, which ended off 1.1%.

A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if TSMC judged it was feasible to increase its U.S. investment, Taiwan's government would help in talks with the United States.

TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The official added that communications between Taiwan and U.S. economic, security and defense officials at present was ""quite good"" and ""strong support from the United States can be felt"".

US support

The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the democratically governed island's most important international backer and arms supplier.

Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan statement following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to Washington called for ""maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"" and voiced support for ""Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations.""

But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

Lai said that the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign investment destination, and that Taiwan is the United States' most reliable trade partner.

Trump has also previously criticized Taiwan, which faces a growing military threat from China, for not spending enough on defense, a criticism he has made of many U.S. allies.

""Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves,"" Lai said, adding his government is working to propose a special budget this year to boost defense spending from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%.

His government is involved in a standoff with parliament, where opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the budget, including defense spending.

""Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed concern to us, worried whether Taiwan's determination for its self-defense has weakened,"" Lai said."
VOA News,Trump signals aggressive stance as US races China in AI development,2025-01-22T19:11:52-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signals-aggressive-stance-as-us-races-china-in-ai-development/7947068.html,"Before he had been in office for 48 hours, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal that to outpace China, his administration will be pursuing an aggressive agenda when it comes to pushing the United States forward on the development of artificial intelligence and the infrastructure that powers it.

On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order signed in 2023 by former President Joe Biden that sought to place some guardrails around the development of more and more powerful generative AI tools and to create other protections for privacy, civil rights and national security.

The following day, Trump met with the leaders of several leading technology firms, including Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle; and Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, to announce a $500 billion private sector investment in AI infrastructure known as Stargate.

“Beginning immediately, Stargate will be building the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in AI, and this will include the construction of colossal data centers,” Trump said in a media event at the White House on Tuesday.

Specifically, Stargate will invest in the creation of as many as 10 huge data centers in the United States that will provide the computing for artificial intelligence systems. The first data center is already under construction in Texas. The massive private sector investment will create up to 100,000 U.S. jobs, the executives said.

Keeping AI in the US

“What we want to do is, we want to keep it in this country,” Trump said. “China is a competitor, and others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we're making it available. I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations, because we have an emergency. We have to get this stuff built.”

The assembled tech leaders took the opportunity to praise the new president.

“I think this will be the most important project of this era,” Altman said. “We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.”

Janet Egan, a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, said that all the signals Trump is sending indicate he is serious about maintaining the United States’ current advantages in the development of advanced AI.

“I think this shows that he's going to have a really clear mind as to how to partner closely with the private sector to enable them to speed up and run fast,” Egan said. “We've also seen him take direct action on some of the bottlenecks that are impeding the development of AI infrastructure in the U.S., and a particular focus is energy.”

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has relied on Microsoft data centers for its computing. The firm reportedly discussed with the Biden administration the regulatory hurdles of planning and permitting when building data centers.

In a policy paper released earlier this month, OpenAI cited the competition with China, laying out its policy proposals to “extending America’s global leadership in AI innovation.”

“Chips, data, energy and talent are the keys to winning on AI — and this is a race America can and must win,” the paper said. “There’s an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn’t attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects — strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence.”

Patrick Hedger, director of policy at NetChoice, a technology trade association, told VOA that the Stargate announcement “immediately signaled to me that private capital is more than willing to come off the sidelines these days with the new Trump administration.”

As part of his flurry of executive actions on Monday, Trump eliminated several preexisting executive orders placing limits on fossil fuel extraction and power generation. In the White House event on Monday, Trump also noted that AI data centers consume vast amounts of electricity and said he would be clearing the way for Stargate and other private companies to invest in new energy generation projects.

China competition

While Trump eliminated many of Biden’s executive orders immediately on Monday, he does not appear to have taken action against some of the former president’s other AI-related initiatives. Last year, Biden took several steps to restrict China’s access to cutting-edge technology related to AI, specifically, restricting the ability of companies that sell advanced semiconductors and the machinery used to produce them to Chinese firms.On that issue, Egan said, Trump and Biden appear to be on the same page.“I think it's important to also note the continuity in how Trump's approaching AI,” she said. “He, too, sees it as a national security risk and national security imperative. ... So, I think we should expect to see this run-fast approach to AI complemented by continued efforts to understand and manage emerging risks. Particularly cyber, nuclear, biological risks, as well as a more muscular approach to export controls and enforcement.”Speed and safetyLouis Rosenberg, CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI and a prominent figure in the field for decades, told VOA he thinks there is a bipartisan consensus that AI needs to be developed speedily but also responsibly.

“At the highest level, the accelerating risks around frontier AI is not a partisan issue,” he wrote in an email exchange. “Both parties realize that significant safeguards will be needed as AI gets increasingly intelligent and flexible, especially as autonomous AI agents get released at large scale.”

Rosenberg said the most significant question is how the U.S. can remain the global leader in AI development while making sure the systems that are deployed are safe and reliable.

“I suspect the Trump administration will address AI risks by deploying its own targeted policies that are not as broad as the Biden executive order was but can address real threats much faster,” he wrote. “The Biden executive order was very useful in raising the alarm about AI, but from a practical perspective it did not provide meaningful protections from the important emerging risks.

“Ultimately we need to find a way to move fast on AI development and move fast on AI protection. We need speed on both fronts,” Rosenberg said.

Lawmakers approved a new growth target for 2025 of at least 8% proposed by the government, an increase from the previous goal of 6.5% to 7.0%.

""With faster economic growth, macro stability must still be ensured while inflation must be kept under control,"" the government said in a report to parliament. The report said inflation would be kept between 4.5% and 5.0% this year.

Parliament also passed a resolution supporting construction of a new railway,linking a major seaport in northern Vietnam with China. The project is expected to cost $8.3 billion, part of which to be funded by loans from the Chinese government.

Vietnam, a regional manufacturing hub heavily reliant on exports to drive its economy, has been seeking to ramp up infrastructure investment to boost growth.

Lawmakers approved policies to develop nuclear power plants, the first of which is set to be built by the end of 2031.

Under the policies, the government can appoint contractors to construct the plants without holding a tender process.

Parliament approved rules that would allow Elon Musk's Starlink to provide satellite internet services in the country while maintaining full ownership of any local subsidiary. And a plan to offer financial support to local firms that enter the semiconductor industry was also supported.

On Tuesday, the assembly approved a bold bureaucratic reform plan that will slash up to a fifth of government bodies, as it tries to cut costs and improve administrative efficiency."

Apple says it will expand teams and facilities in nine statesacross the country and that it aims to open a 23,200-square-meter server manufacturing facility in Texas in 2026.

The announcement comes just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with U.S. President Donald Trump.

“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said on the investment.

“From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation,” he added in a company statement.

Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the investment on Monday morning on the social media platform Truth Social.

“Apple has just announced a record $500 billion investment in the United States of America. The reason, faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn’t be investing 10 cents,” Trump said.

Most of Apple’s consumer goods are currently assembled and produced overseas. Many of them, assembled in China, are liable to 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier in February.

To reduce its reliance on international supply chains, Apple announced in January that it had begun mass producing its own chips at an Arizona factory owned by TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

The TSMC Arizona factory, along with legislation aimed at increasing U.S. semiconductor production, were two of Trump’s largest industrial policy moves during his first term.

In a release on its website, Apple said the $500 billion commitment includes the company’s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ production in 20 states.

Apple said it is also set to open a manufacturing academy in Michigan, offering training led by engineers and local university staff to support mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas like project management and manufacturing processes."
VOA News,Biden's top aide to make China-focused visit to India,2025-01-03T20:31:51-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-s-top-aide-to-make-china-focused-visit-to-india-/7924089.html,"President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will make his final visit to India next week to emphasize Washington's partnership with New Delhi, the White House announced Friday.

The visit will cap the Biden administration's efforts to maximize ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, in its strategic focus to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.

Strengthening ties with India has been a ""real foreign policy priority and area of legacy achievement for the Biden administration,"" a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters Friday.

Sullivan will visit New Delhi January 5-6 to discuss a range of issues, including civil nuclear partnership, China's overcapacity on semiconductor and biopharma supply chains, strategic technology cooperation and other shared security priorities, a second administration official said.

Sullivan's visit comes as tension is brewing between India and China over Beijing's plan to build what it calls the ""world's largest"" hydro dam on the Yarlung Zangbo River on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau, which could affect millions downstream in India and Bangladesh.

Sullivan is expected to discuss the dam along with other regional issues of concern, said the first administration official in response to VOA's question. ""What matters to us is that when it comes to water resources that have to be managed across countries, that those are being handled fairly and in an equitable way,"" the official said.

Technology initiative

A key focus of the visit is the U.S.-Indiainitiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET)– an effort that Biden and Modi announced in May 2022 to bolster their strategic technology partnership and defense-industrial cooperation between their governments, businesses and academic institutions across various domains, from AI to quantum computing, and from semiconductors to space.

Sullivan's visit will take place just two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office January 20. Many expect iCET to continue under his administration.

""There is broad bipartisan support for some of the goals of iCET,"" said the second administration official in response to VOA's question. They include ""strengthening the resilience of technology supply chains, working with allies and partners to position ourselves to offset PRC [People Republic of China's] advancements in certain technologies, and efforts to dominate some of the supply chains.""

The U.S. strategic partnership with New Delhi is ""based upon a bet that India's economic, technological and military rise is critical to pushing back and containing China's dominance in these fields,"" said Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute.

Irritants have not derailed bilateral ties. Those include India's democratic backsliding, and the case of a former Indian government employee charged in New York last year with murder-for-hire over his role in directing a foiled plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist and Modi critic.

Most of Biden's policies on India will likely continue, Pande told VOA, as Trump's desire to ""push back or contain China's rise – economic, technological and military – will help ensure that India is seen as a partner in this endeavor.""

During his first administration, Trump had a warm relationship with Modi. Trump attended a 2019 ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Texas, and Modi reciprocated by hosting a ""Namaste Trump"" rally in Ahmedabad in 2020."
VOA News,China sets moderate economic growth target amid looming trade war,2025-03-05T01:46:10-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-sets-moderate-economic-growth-target-amid-looming-trade-war/7998344.html,"China set the economic growth target for 2025 at 5% on Wednesday, vowing to “rise to the challenge and strive for success” amid a lack of domestic demand and a challenging external environment.

Delivering the government work report at the start of China’s biggest political meetings of the year, Chinese Premier Li Qiang acknowledged that China’s trade and tech sectors face mounting external pressure caused by the intensification of protectionism around the world, the obstruction of the multilateral trading system, the increase of tariff barriers and rising geopolitical tensions.

“Domestically, the foundation for economic recovery is not yet solid, and there is insufficient demand, especially the sluggish consumption,” Li said during a speech delivered in front of thousands of members of the Chinese Communist Party, including Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In light of these challenges, Li said the Chinese government aims to achieve the 5% economic growth target by “vigorously boosting consumption, improving the efficiency of investment and expanding domestic demand on all fronts,” according to a readout released by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.

“Achieving these goals won’t be easy, and it will require hard work,” he said.

Analysts say the economic growth target shows China is prioritizing “stability” over “major economic progress” in 2025. “A large part of China's economic growth last year was supported by exports, but the looming trade war with the United States has brought unpredictable risks to Chinese exports in 2025,” said Wang Kuo-chen, an economist at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research in Taiwan.

“Since China’s domestic demand remains insufficient, they can only rely on boosting consumption to drive economic growth in 2025,” he told VOA by phone.

To boost domestic consumption and demand, Li said Beijing will introduce some bold stimulus measures, including implementing more vigorous fiscal policies, lowering interest rates at the right time, and implementing economic policies aimed at “improving people’s livelihoods and boosting domestic consumption.”

The Chinese government will aim to direct more resources and capital to “support the expansion of employment, help people increase their income, and strengthen consumption incentives,” Li said during the speech.

Wang in Taiwan said while the Chinese government has repeatedly vowed to boost domestic consumption since last year, the exodus of foreign businesses and the overall trend of income reduction across the country will make it difficult for China to achieve this goal in 2025.

“As long as more capitals are poured into emerging industries such as electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, which are key sectors highlighted by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the private sector as a whole will remain weak, and there won’t be sufficient domestic demand,” Wang said.

To maintain China’s competitiveness in emerging industries, Li said China in 2025 will focus on stimulating innovation and the digital economy.

Relevant measures include better combining digital technology with manufacturing and market advantages and “vigorously developing new-generation intelligent terminals such as intelligent network-connected new-energy vehicles and intelligent manufacturing equipment.”

In addition to artificial intelligence, other emerging industries that Li said China also aims to further develop in 2025 include quantum technology, embodied technology, and 6G.

Before the annual legislative meetings, Chinese President Xi Jinping held a symposium with leaders from several Chinese tech giants on February 17, urging “efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the country's private sector.”

Some experts say that while the Chinese government wants to provide more state-led support to private companies in the AI and semiconductor industries, they will also ensure these companies “align themselves with China’s national priorities.”

“The government knows it needs the private sector for innovation and job creation, but it also wants to maintain control at the same time,” Lizzi Lee, a fellow on the Chinese economy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told VOA in an e-mail.

China’s week-long legislative meetings come as Beijing and Washington gear up for a potential trade war. On Tuesday, the United States enhanced tariffs against all Chinese imports to 20%, prompting China to retaliate by imposing tariffs ranging between 10% to 15% on a wide range of agricultural products from the U.S.

During his speech on Wednesday, Li said China will “stick to the path of peaceful development, oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and uphold international justice.”

“China is willing to work with the international community to call for an equal and orderly multipolar world and an inclusive economic globalization,” he said during the hour-long remarks.

In light of the U.S. government’s tariff hikes against several countries, including allies such as Canada and Mexico, some analysts say Beijing is trying to present itself as a “more responsible” global power.

“China might actually see an opportunity to show that it can act more responsibly on certain global issues,” Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago, told VOA by phone.

VOA News,China urges US to 'correct its mistakes' after State Department removes Taiwan web reference,2025-02-17T03:17:14-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-us-to-correct-its-mistakes-after-state-department-removes-taiwan-web-reference/7977487.html,"China on Monday urged the United States to ""correct its mistakes"" after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said was part of a routine update.

The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington's opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which claims the democratically governed island as its own.

But as well as dropping the phrase ""we do not support Taiwan independence,"" the page added a reference to Taiwan's cooperation with a Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the U.S. will support Taiwan's membership in international organizations ""where applicable.""

Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as encouraging Taiwan's separate status from China.

The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White House.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department's website were a big step backwards and ""sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan independence separatist forces.""

""This is yet another example of the United States' stubborn adherence to the erroneous policy of 'using Taiwan to suppress China'. We urge the United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,"" Guo said.

The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

""As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,"" a State Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time responding to questions on the updated website wording.

""The United States remains committed to its one China policy,"" the spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position on Taiwan's sovereignty and only acknowledging China's position on the subject.

""The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" the spokesperson said.

""We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.""

On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his appreciation for what he called the ""support and positive stance on U.S.-Taiwan relations.""

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying that only the island's people can decide their future.

Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, who set up the People's Republic of China."
VOA News,Former Google engineer faces new US charges he stole AI secrets for Chinese companies,2025-02-04T20:18:06-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/former-google-engineer-faces-new-us-charges-he-stole-ai-secrets-for-chinese-companies-/7963387.html,"U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for.

Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.

Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine.

The defendant, also known as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. He is free on bond. His lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ding's case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration.

The initiative was designed to help stop advanced technology from being acquired by countries such as China and Russia or potentially threatening national security.

Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google's supercomputing data centers train large AI models.

Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon and Microsoft, which design their own, and reduce Google's reliance on chips from Nvidia.

Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company.

Ding allegedly uploaded more than 1,000 confidential files by May 2023 and later circulated a PowerPoint presentation to employees of a China startup he founded, saying that country's policies encouraged development of a domestic AI industry.

Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement.

According to court records describing a December 18 hearing, prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed a ""potential resolution"" to Ding's case, ""but anticipate the matter proceeding to trial.""

The case is U.S. v. Ding, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-cr-00141."
VOA News,"Taiwan considers multibillion-dollar arms purchase from US, sources say",2025-02-17T19:00:17-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-considers-multibillion-dollar-arms-purchase-from-us-sources-say-/7978401.html,"Taiwan is exploring buying arms worth billions of dollars from the United States, sources briefed on the matter said, hoping to win support from the new Trump administration as China continues to apply military pressure on the island.

Three sources familiar with the situation, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters that Taiwan is in talks with Washington.

The package is meant to demonstrate to the United States that Taiwan is committed to its defense, one of the sources said.

A second source said the package would include coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rockets.

""I would be very surprised if it was less than $8 billion. Somewhere between $7 billion to $10 billion,"" the source added.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz has said he wants to speed delivery of weapons to Taiwan.

Taiwan's defense ministry declined to comment on specific purchases but said it is focused on building its defenses.

""Any weaponry and equipment that can achieve those goals for building the military are listed as targets for tender,"" it said.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan strongly objects to China’s sovereignty claims and says only the island’s people can decide their future.

Trump-Taiwan relations

U.S. President Donald Trump unnerved chip powerhouse Taiwan on the election campaign trail by saying the island stole American semiconductor business. This month, he threatened tariffs on chip imports.

But his administration maintained diplomatic support for the Chinese-claimed island.

Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba issued a joint statement on Feb. 7 opposing any attempt to change the current situation in the Taiwan Strait through force or coercion. The U.S. State Department also removed language on its website that it does not support Taiwan independence, a move praised by the island's government. China has urged the U.S. to ""correct its mistakes.""

Taiwan plans to propose a special defense budget that prioritizes precision ammunition, air-defense upgrades, command and control systems, equipment for the reserve forces and anti-drone technology, a third source familiar with the matter said.

During his 2017-2021 term, Trump established regular arms sales to Taiwan, including multibillion-dollar deals for F-16 fighter jets. The Biden administration continued these sales, though often with smaller price tags.

Taiwanese officials see encouraging signs from Trump's administration even as tariff threats weigh on that optimism.

Taiwan does not believe Trump is looking to make a ""grand bargain"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping to sell out Taiwan's interests, one of the sources said. Trump is more concerned with putting tariffs on semiconductors, the source said.

In another sign of U.S. commitment to Taiwan, the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Raymond Greene, will retain his post, three sources told Reuters, even as other U.S. diplomatic postings undergo major reshuffles.

A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Greene remains director of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial U.S. Embassy in Taipei."
VOA News,Taiwan's president says Beijing remains the obstacle for resuming cross-strait exchanges,2025-01-01T00:40:18-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-says-beijing-remains-the-obstacle-for-resuming-cross-strait-exchanges/7920716.html,"Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te reiterated his administration’s willingness to welcome equal and dignified exchanges with China but said Beijing remains the obstacle for both sides to resume regular exchanges.

""Taiwan hopes to have healthy and orderly exchanges with China under the principle of reciprocal dignity, and [Beijing] can cooperate with Taiwan openly and generously,"" Lai said during his first New Year address since becoming president in May 2024.

He added that China’s attempt to weaken Taiwan’s democracy would only be ""counterproductive"" to conducting cross-strait exchanges and earning Taiwanese people’s trust.

Lai said Beijing is blocking civil society exchanges across the Taiwan Strait by restricting Chinese tourists from visiting the island or preventing Chinese students from studying in Taiwan.

""From this, we can see that the real obstacle to cross-strait exchanges is China, not Taiwan,"" he told journalists gathering at the presidential office in Taipei.

Apart from addressing cross-strait dynamics, Lai warned about the threat that authoritarian countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea pose to the rules-based international order.

""Authoritarian regimes continue to cooperate and threaten the rule-based international order, seriously affecting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,"" he said, adding that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is a ""necessary element"" for global security and prosperity.

""Taiwan must be prepared for danger even in times of peace, continue to enhance its defense budget, strengthen its defense capabilities, and showcase the determination to defend itself,"" Lai added.

Lai’s speech comes as China continues to increase military pressure against Taiwan. Since he took office last May, China has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan and increased the frequency of deploying military aircraft and naval vessels to waters and airspaces near the island.

China views Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunify with the island, through force if necessary. During his New Year address on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated the message that Beijing’s efforts to reunify with Taipei cannot be stopped.

""No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times,"" Xi said in his 10-minute televised address.

Analysts say Lai is trying to create ""a new narrative"" about relations between Taiwan and China by highlighting the collective threat that authoritarian countries pose to democracies around the world.

""He is grouping China with other authoritarian regimes and portraying China as a threat to the democratic world, in which Taiwan is a member,"" said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania.

""This new narrative not only aims to highlight and promote Taiwan's separate identity from China but is also geared towards winning international support for Taiwan's de facto independence,"" he told VOA in a written response.

During his roughly 20-minute speech, the Taiwanese president said the island will continue to defend democracy and its democratic way of life under his leadership.

""Regardless of the threats and challenges to Taiwan, democracy is the only way for us and there is no turning back,"" Lai said.

""The safer Taiwan is, the safer the world will be, and the stronger Taiwan is; the stronger the world's democratic defenses will be,"" he added.

Zhu said Lai’s rhetoric is unlikely to soften Beijing’s pressure and intimidation against Taiwan in 2025. ""He highlighted the importance of strengthening Taiwan’s ability to deter Beijing’s invasion, combating information and cognitive warfare, raising Taiwan’s defense budget, and boosting its military power,"" he told VOA.

""This is not music to Beijing’s ears and Beijing’s view that Lai is a diehard separatist is unlikely to change, which means that official contacts between the two sides are unlikely to resume in the near future,"" Zhu added.

Focus on economic diplomacy in 2025

To highlight Taiwan’s efforts to deepen engagement with like-minded democracies, Lai said Taiwan has redirected investments to democratic countries, including Japan and the United States, in recent years.

""Taiwan's investment in the U.S., Japan, and Europe has risen sharply, significantly surpassing that in China,"" he said, adding that the trend shows Taipei’s efforts reduce reliance on a single market.

Additionally, Lai said Taiwan will utilize its advantages in the semiconductor and AI sector to strengthen the resilience of the ""democratic supply chain"" with democracies around the world.

Taiwan needs to ""master advanced technologies and promote diversified development so that Taiwan can continue to lead the advancement of the global democratic supply chain and also ensure the security and stability of the global democratic supply chain,"" he added.

Experts say these signals show that Taiwan will focus on deepening relations with other democratic countries through economic diplomacy in 2025.

""From his speech, we can see the core of Taiwan’s economic diplomacy is democracy, and based on this principle, Taiwan can use its strength in advanced technologies to deepen relations with like-minded countries,"" Hung Chin-fu, a political science professor at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone.

Hung said as China struggles to boost its sluggish economy and Lai continues to portray Taiwan as part of the democratic world, relations between Beijing and Taipei are not likely to improve in 2025.

""China’s military intimidation against Taiwan will likely continue in 2025 because Beijing needs to use it as a distraction from the ongoing economic downturn the country is experiencing,"" he told VOA."
VOA News,Thailand leader seeks more cooperation with China,2025-02-08T19:22:44-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-leader-seeks-more-cooperation-with-china/7968278.html,"Thailand's prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, vowed to deepen cooperation with China to tackle the cyber scam centers that have troubled both countries, and she signed more than a dozen agreements to elevate bilateral economic ties between the two nations at the conclusion of her visit to China on Saturday.

Some analysts say the Thai prime minister's four-day visit shows that Thailand is managing its relationship with China ""quite well.""

""The trip signaled that Thailand is willing to cooperate proactively on a number of fronts that will benefit Thailand economically and enhance Thailand's ability to protect its security interests in neighboring Myanmar,"" said Hunter Marston, a research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia.

Ahead of her first official visit to China since taking power last August, Paetongtarn said she hoped to demonstrate Thailand's commitment to crack down on illegal cyber scam centers operating in areas near the Thai-Myanmar-Chinese border.

On Tuesday, Thai authorities announced they would suspend electricity to some border areas close to Myanmar, as the government intensified efforts to target cyberscam operations.

Additionally, the Thai leader was seeking Beijing's help to boost Chinese tourist confidence in traveling to Thailand. The abduction of Chinese television actor Wang Xing from the Southeast Asian country to a scam center in neighboring Myanmar has sparked widespread concern among Chinese tourists about the risks of traveling to Thailand.

During a bilateral meeting with Paetongtarn in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping praised Thailand's ""efforts and effective measures"" to combat online gambling and telecom fraud, and said both countries should ""strengthen law enforcement, security and judicial cooperation to safeguard the safety of people's lives and property.""

Apart from promising to ""take resolute and effective measures"" to combat cyber scam operations, the Thai prime minister also said she takes Chinese citizens' safety in her country ""seriously.""

""I personally looked into all the securities myself, I talked to the police, I talked to the military and everybody who is involved"" ... ""to be able to take care of everybody that wants to come to Thailand,"" Paetongtarn said during an interview this week with China's state-runChina Daily.

Experts say that while the willingness by China and Thailand to strengthen law enforcement cooperation could help push cyber scam centers farther away from the border region, it's unlikely to entirely root out illegal operations.

The cyber scam operations ""will find some other place where they can slip to unless the Thais and the Chinese are willing to do significant cross-border operations into Myanmar,"" said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore.

Paul Chambers, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Naresuan University in Thailand, told VOA that one potential risk of increasing law enforcement cooperation between Beijing and Bangkok is that there could be ""a much heightened and unaccountable Chinese police presence in Thailand.""

And since the United States Agency for International Development used to be a ""major funder"" of counter-human trafficking efforts in Thailand, Chong said the Trump administration's decision to freeze foreign aid could complicate Beijing and Bangkok's efforts to crack down on the cyber scam gangs.

""What the meeting between Xi and the Thai prime minister didn't talk about is who will provide the money to continue those programs,"" he told VOA by phone.

Deepening economic ties

Apart from strengthening joint efforts to combat cyber scams, Thailand and China also are looking to deepen bilateral economic cooperation in areas like infrastructure, digital economy, and electric vehicles.

One key project is the 609-kilometer-long high-speed railroad connecting Thailand with southern China through neighboring Laos, which Bangkok hopes to finish building by 2030.

Chinese President Xi said he hoped both countries would ""promote the vision of interconnected development of China, Laos, and Thailand to achieve more fruitful outcomes as soon as possible"".

Additionally, Thailand and China signed 14 agreements related to cooperation in artificial intelligence, green development, and fish product exports during Paetongtarn's meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

Marston said, while China says the high-speed railway could help enhance their connectivity with regional countries, Thailand hopes to further develop key industries through deepened economic cooperation with Beijing.

Bangkok hopes ""the relocation of Chinese manufacturing to Thailand could help them develop their own semiconductor and electric vehicle manufacturing capacity,"" Marston told VOA by phone.

Other analysts warn, however, that Thailand's enhanced cooperation with China over electric vehicles could adversely affect other countries' automobile manufacturing in Thailand.

""What may be good for China in the EV market may not necessarily be good for other countries, such as Japan, that have traditionally made automobiles and have supplied a lot of middle-class jobs in Thailand,"" Mark Cogan, an expert on Southeast Asian affairs at Kansai Gaidai University in Japan, told VOA in a video interview via Zoom.

As the United States threatens to impose tariffs against products from several countries, including longstanding allies like Canada, and vows to boycott global summits like the G20, Marston said China sees a window of opportunity to further relations with neighboring countries like Thailand.

""China will be making every effort to deepen relations with Southeast Asian countries and impress upon them the perception that the U.S. is not reliable,"" he told VOA.

Marston said while Thailand is trying to expand engagement with China, it also isn't distancing itself from the U.S., which has long been Bangkok's key security partner.

""Thailand is well positioned to continue its bamboo diplomacy, and we will likely see it maintain positive relations with both China and the U.S. in the years ahead,"" he said."
VOA News,"Trump places tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China",2025-02-01T17:39:07-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-enacts-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china-/7959588.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Saturday that places 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China starting Tuesday, the White House said.

""Both Canada and Mexico have allowed an unprecedented invasion of illegal fentanyl that is killing American citizens, and also illegal immigrants into our country,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during her briefing Friday.

Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was not scheduled to speak to reporters.

While Canadian goods will face a 25% tariff, Trump said he would tariff Canadian crude oil imports at 10%. Mexico’s energy imports are included in its 25% tariffs. For Canada alone, Trump canceled the ""de minimis"" tariff exemption for shipments worth less than $800.

China’s 10% would be on top of various existing tariffs on its goods.

Under the order, there is no process to seek an exception, but there is one to escalate the tariff rates if the countries retaliate.

Mexico and Canada responded later Saturday while China denounced Trump’s action Sunday but left open the possibility for talks to avoid worsening the situation.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. move, saying in a post on X that her government would prefer dialogue but had been forced to respond.

""I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and nontariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,"" she wrote.

She also rejected ""the White House’s slander that the Mexican government has alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any intention of meddling in our territory.""

""If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious fentanyl consumption in their country, they could fight the sale of drugs on the streets of their major cities, which they don’t do, and the laundering of money that this illegal activity generates that has done so much harm to its population,"" she wrote.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that Canada would retaliate against the U.S. action with 25% tariffs on U.S. goods, saying that the tariffs would apply to $155 billion in U.S. goods, with those on $30 billion to go into effect Tuesday those on the other $125 billion in 21 days.

He also said Canada is looking at nontariff measures, possibly relating to critical minerals, energy and other partnerships.

China on Sunday denounced the U.S. tariff on China, saying it would challenge the move in at the World Trade Organizations and take ""corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights and interests.""

While its Commerce Ministry said the U.S. move “seriously violates” international trade rules, it urged Washington to ""engage in frank dialogue and strengthen cooperation.""

'Negative impact’ predicted

China, Mexico and Canada account for more than one-third of the goods and services imported into or bought from the United States.

Some economists warn that the tariffs could backfire.

Imports from Mexico and Canada make up around 3% of U.S. gross domestic product, while exports make up around 2.5% of U.S. GDP, Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said.

A 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada amounts to a ""tax hike on imports from those countries"" and will ""have an immediate and negative impact on the U.S. economy,"" he told VOA. ""It's a strategy for shrinking the U.S. economy.""

Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs to pressure countries to help his administration stop illegal immigration and the smuggling of chemicals used for fentanyl. He has pledged to use tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing and has praised their use as an effective economic policy.

Trump believes that ""tariffs are a great source of leverage,"" and that he will ""convince Canada and Mexico to make big concessions under the threat of tariffs,"" Setser said. ""But these measures are going to be pretty costly to the U.S.""

Trump acknowledged that the tariffs might cause a ""short-term disruption"" for consumers but said they would lead to a long-term benefit for U.S. manufacturing.

""Tariffs don't cause inflation. Tariffs cause success,"" he added.

Trump had vowed Friday to impose sweeping tariffs on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, steel and aluminum, and oil and gas.

""All forms of medicine and pharmaceuticals,"" Trump said. ""And we'll be doing, very importantly, steel, and we'll also be doing chips and things associated with chips.""

Trump warned he would ""absolutely"" place tariffs on goods from the European Union.

""They're treating us so badly,"" he said.

In imposing the tariffs, he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House said Saturday the act was needed because of ""the extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl, constitutes a national emergency.""

Free trade agreement

During his first administration, in 2018, Trump negotiated and signed the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, in part to narrow the large U.S. trade deficit — the gap between what it exports and what it imports — with its neighbors. He once called the deal ""the fairest, most balanced and beneficial trade agreement we have ever signed into law.""

However, the U.S. trade deficit in goods with Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023.

""He's now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency fix,"" said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

There is no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market economy that is not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors said. ""Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,"" he added.

Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs ""don't stop illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in Mexico.""

VOA News,EU official meets with Trump counterparts to resolve tariff threats,2025-02-20T17:51:00-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-official-meets-with-trump-counterparts-to-resolve-tariff-threats-/7982535.html,"Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration officials.

“The top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our American partners is reciprocity,” Maros Sefcovic, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a Thursday briefing.

Sefcovic met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S. trade representative.

Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American products.

But Trump's plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added tax — which is akin to a sales tax — charged in Europe that could drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt political support for Trump, as voters in 2024's election specifically wanted him to lower price pressures.

Trump also has proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide exceptions or exemptions.

Additionally, the U.S. president also has tariffs ready on Mexico and Canada over his claims that more should be done on illegal immigration and drug smuggling, though he suspended those tariffs for 30 days for ongoing talks. The import taxes that could potentially harm the U.S. auto sector and other industries could potentially begin in March.

At Thursday's White House news briefing, Hassett said that he and Lutnick had talks with a Mexican delegation about resolving the issues.

“We want trade to be fair,” Hassett said.

The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been resolved.

Sefcovic also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other.

He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways to “generate positive momentum,” adding that the EU would like to “see where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.”

The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal relationship with his U.S. counterparts.

“I’m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense meeting,” he said. “Now, I think we will both be thinking how to keep the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the pain.”"
VOA News,India's defense minister cites power rivalry in Indian Ocean region,2025-01-15T07:04:53-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-defense-minister-cites-power-rivalry-in-indian-ocean-region-/7937502.html,"International power rivalry is playing out in the Indian Ocean region, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday, adding that a strong naval presence in the key trade route was his country's biggest priority.

While Singh did not name any country, analysts say that China, which commands the world's largest naval force with more than 370 ships, has been a security concern for India since ties nosedived in 2020 after 24 troops died in clashes along their Himalayan frontier.

The UK and the U.S. also have a joint military base in the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.

Chinese and Indian troops have pulled back from two face-off points after a deal was struck in October following a series of talks, but India's army chief told reporters this week that ""a degree of standoff"" still persists.

""A large part of the world's trade and commerce passes through the Indian Ocean region. Due to geo-strategic reasons, the region is also becoming a part of international power rivalry,"" Defense Minister Singh said during the induction of one submarine and two navy ships in the city of Mumbai.

He said 95% of India's trade, in terms of volume, is linked to the Indian Ocean region. ""In such a situation, the presence of a strong Indian Navy becomes our biggest priority,"" he said.

India has sought to counter China as Beijing grows its influence in India's neighborhood through investments and development projects in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

New Delhi plans to build a 175-ship strong naval force by 2035 with an increasing emphasis on using domestically made components, but analysts say the pace of construction is slow as compared to China, which builds almost 14 warships a year, while India constructs just four."

However, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with Mexico has widened from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion in 2023, according to government data. The trade gap in goods with Canada has also increased, from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023.

""He's now acting like his deal caused a disaster needing an emergency fix,"" said Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

There's no justification for high tariffs on Canada, a market economy that's not in the top five of U.S. trade deficits, Scissors said.

""Fentanyl shipments across the Canadian border are tiny,"" he added.

Fentanyl and illegal migration are justifications for border restrictions on Mexico, Scissors said. However, tariffs ""don't stop illegal immigration and probably encourage it by threatening jobs in Mexico.""

The stock market erased early gains and closed lower Friday after the White House announcement on tariffs."
VOA News,Trump's inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders,2025-01-19T19:22:06-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-inauguration-will-be-first-attended-by-foreign-leaders/7942860.html,"For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the peaceful transfer of power.

President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi sent his vice president as his representative.

No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay's President Santiago Peña, were special guests Saturday night at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball, where several of Trump's nominees for key Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped to head the Health and Human Services Department.

Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration:

China

Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng.

The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country's foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump's Cabinet picks are known China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China ""the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.""

Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But the two leaders spoke on the phone Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok. Trump said the call was a ""very good one.""

Argentina

Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago club.

Milei is scheduled to attend one of the official inaugural balls that Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in ceremony. The self-described ""anarcho-capitalist,"" who has carried out an audacious economic agenda in the South American nation, got a hug from Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump insider, on stage at Hispanic ball before delivering remarks.

Ramaswamy called him ""an inspiration."" Milei also receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk for implementing a series of austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and pension freezes below inflation.

Musk and Ramaswamy will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal government spending, regulations and personnel.

Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund.

Italy

Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony.

Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S.

Georgia

Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend the ceremony as a guest of Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. Georgia has been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that opposition groups alleged was rigged.

She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili's ruling party has denied those accusations.

Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be ""the big success for America or the big problem for America"" in the region because ""Russia is always trying to dominate.""

France

French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won't be at Trump's inauguration. But far-right figures from the country have said they are traveling for the inauguration.

Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they will attend. Zemmour was convicted multiple times of inciting racist or religious hatred.

Prominent far-right politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027 presidential election.

Who else?

The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Pena have said they were invited to the inauguration and planned to attend.

Pena, a conservative economist turned politician, praised Trump's agenda and said at the Hispanic ball that he hoped for deeper ties between U.S. and Latin America.

Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to Washington for Trump's inauguration, but Taiwan's foreign ministry said its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved indoors because of cold weather.

Taiwan's official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan's foreign ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations. It's unclear if they will meet Trump.

Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly improved during his first term.

On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue ""with prudence"" because it is about China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory and vows to annex it by force if necessary."
VOA News,Trump team might step in to save TikTok from US ban after high court upholds law,2025-01-16T20:11:14-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-team-might-step-in-to-save-tiktok-from-pending-us-ban-/7940010.html,"With a law declaring the social media application TikTok illegal in the United States, set to take effect on Sunday, the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is signaling that it plans to try to find a way to prevent the service from going offline.

Under the federal law, the service's parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese firm or see it banned in the U.S.

Representative Mike Waltz, who has been tapped to serve as Trump's national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday that the president-elect has options available to postpone enforcement of the law while a possible deal is worked out to sell the company. That includes a section of the law allowing the president to give ByteDance a 90-day extension to finalize a sale.

""We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,"" Waltz said, ""as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.""

Executive action reportedly considered

Also on Wednesday, several media outlets reported that Trump is considering issuing an executive order that would protect TikTok.

The legality of such a move is unclear and is thrown further into doubt by the fact that the Supreme Court ruled Friday upholding the federal law banning TikTok.

Trump's attitude toward TikTok has evolved considerably over the years. During his first term in office, he attempted to shut the service down in the U.S. Since then, though, he has used the service, with considerable success, to connect with his supporters.

In a press conference in Florida last month, Trump said, ""I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,"" and credited the app with helping him get his message out to younger American voters.

Trump has denied that his change of heart about TikTok was influenced by a brief meeting in March with Republican megadonor and ByteDance investor Jeff Yass. Lobbying disclosure reports from 2024 show that ByteDance paid a former Trump campaign aide to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok, and that former senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway has been paid to advocate for TikTok in Congress via the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth.

Trump also said TikTok was not mentioned during his meeting with Yass.

Economic concerns

In the years since TikTok took off, thousands of U.S.-based content creators have developed large audiences on the app, and in many cases have been able to monetize their TikTok feeds.

Many small businesses have found success advertising their products to TikTok users. Other TikTok personalities have parlayed fame on the app into broader celebrity that has led to lucrative product endorsements and other deals.

Some members of Congress have expressed concern that abruptly shutting the app down could have economic consequences.

On Monday, Democratic Senator Edward Markey introduced legislation that would delay the TikTok ban by 270 days.

""Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems,"" Markey said in a statement released by his office. ""Like every social media platform, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.""

Viability of sale unclear

As the Sunday deadline nears, there have been a number of rumors about a possible sale of the company. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Chinese officials were considering the possibility of selling the service to billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser who already owns the social media service X, formerly Twitter.

Another U.S. billionaire, real estate developer Frank McCourt, told Reuters on Thursday that a consortium of investors he had formed has already made a formal offer to purchase TikTok, valuing the service at $20 billion.

However, it is far from clear that a sale is something the Chinese government is prepared to allow. Any sale worth the buyer's investment would have to include the ""recommendation engine,"" TikTok's name for the algorithm that makes the service so popular and, many would say, addictive.

Last year in a court filing, TikTok characterized such a deal as unavailable.

""Just as the United States restricts the export of U.S.-origin technologies (e.g., certain computer chips), the Chinese government regulates the transfer of technologies developed in China,"" the company argued in a court filing. ""The Chinese government has made clear in public statements that it would not permit a forced divestment of the recommendation engine.""

Privacy, national security worries

A wildly popular service for sharing short videos, TikTok has an estimated 170 million U.S. users. Federal officials have been concerned about TikTok for years because it collects vast amounts of information about its user base. They have argued that Chinese laws compelling domestic companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies could be used to force the company to share that data with the Chinese Communist Party.

U.S. officials have expressed concern that China could misuse the private information about U.S. users of the service. They have also warned that Beijing could use TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm to shape public discourse in the U.S. to the benefit of China.

In December, when a federal appeals court upheld the law mandating the company's sale or shutdown, Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, one of the original sponsors of the law, released a statement expressing the thoughts of many of the law's supporters.

""With today's opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok's ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,"" Krishnamoorthi said.

""Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party's control is a day that our security is at risk,"" Krishnamoorthi added."
VOA News,Vance stakes claim to US leadership in AI,2025-02-11T20:18:29-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-stakes-forceful-claim-to-us-leadership-in-ai/7971777.html,"U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United States would maintain its leadership position in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries not to adopt regulatory standards that might ""kill"" the new technology ""just as it's taking off.""

""The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way,"" Vance told an audience of world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of President Donald Trump ""will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured chips.""

Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies. ""But,"" he said, ""to create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation.""

Regulations criticized

The vice president criticized the European Union's regulatory structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments ""tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints.""

Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources, saying that countries are ""chasing reliable power out of their nations"" at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to electricity.

""The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety,"" Vance said. ""It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the future.""

While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint declaration on ""building trustworthy data governance frameworks to encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI,"" the U.S. and U.K. did not.

More calls for reduced regulation

Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened.

French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, said that while safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other countries.

""At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world,"" Macron said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the bloc's privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly across all 27 member countries.

""At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have to cut red tape — and we will,"" von der Leyen said.

Veiled China comments

Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit, said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with the aim of creating ""a community with a shared future for mankind.""

In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of collaboration that Zhang described.

Vance spoke of ""hostile foreign adversaries"" that ""have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech"" and authoritarian regimes that have ""stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national security.""

Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, ""means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure.""

The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to restrict access to the service.

On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a press conference: ""We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus contributing China's part to global AI development.""

""We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building, advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national security, or politicizing trade and tech issues,"" Gou said.

Tech researchers concerned

Vance's remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his predecessor entitled, ""Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.""

Following Vance's remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult.

""In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets,"" Susan Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation's Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society.

""Many AI researchers believe we're running out of data,"" Aaronson said. ""The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with policymakers and users in those markets.""

Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is a prevailing concern.

""If you talk to people in the research community in the United States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their research,"" she said.

""There will be very severe implications for research in the United States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these international conversations,"" Sloane said."
VOA News,"In farewell address, Biden warns of concentration of power and wealth",2025-01-15T12:18:29-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-bids-farewell-with-oval-office-address-/7937842.html,"In his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday evening, U.S. President Joe Biden warned of the dangers of the concentration of power and wealth, highlighting the emergence of an ""oligarchy"" and a ""tech-industrial complex.""

""The dangerous concentration of power in the hands of a very few ultra wealthy people, the dangerous consequences if their abuse of power is left unchecked,"" he said. ""Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedom.""

The president did not say who he meant by oligarchy. But some of the nation’s biggest billionaires including Elon Musk have forged close ties with President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday.

Musk spent more than $100 million towards Trump’s reelection, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos have made large donations to Trump's inaugural committee.

Without mentioning names, Biden made a jab at Zuckerberg’s recent decision that his social media company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, will stop working with fact checkers.

""The free press is crumbling. Editors are disappearing. Social media is giving up on fact checking,"" Biden said. ""The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.""

Gaza ceasefire

Biden ended his term on a high note on foreign policy. Just hours earlier, he announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire-and-hostage agreement in Gaza.

""It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy,""Biden said in a statement. ""My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done.""

The deal will largely be implemented by the incoming administration, and in his farewell Biden said he is instructing his team to keep the incoming administration fully informed.

Trump immediately sought to take credit for the deal, posting on social media that ""the ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November.""

On the foreign policy front, the administration insists it is leaving the incoming administration with a ""very strong hand to play.""

""We're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure,"" Biden said in his foreign policy address delivered Monday. ""An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.""

The president again defended his decision to withdraw the United States from Afghanistan in 2021. Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the manner with which Biden ended America's longest war as chaotic, costing the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack in Kabul.

Winter of peril and possibilities

In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden reflected on how his administration began in the shadows of COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters intent on overturning the result of the 2020 election that Biden won.

""Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities,""he said in the letter. ""But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.""

It was Biden’s fifth and final formal address from the Oval Office. In his previous Oval Office address six months ago, he explained his decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, to run against Trump in the 2024 election.

The president’s farewell address comes a day after Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump on charges of illegally trying to cling to power after the 2020 election, released his final report. Smith’s report said the evidence would have been sufficient to convict the president-elect in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made it impossible for the prosecution to continue.

Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated.

In July the U.S. Supreme Court granted Trump sweeping protections from criminal liability over his role in trying to undermine his 2020 defeat. Biden used his farewell address to call for a constitutional amendment to end immunity for sitting presidents.

Biden’s legacy

Biden is leaving office with a 39% approval rating, according to Gallup. Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said the president’s legacy will be affected by how Trump governs in the next four years.

""If Trump ends up being a disaster … either ushering economic chaos, or if there's more world chaos from conflicts, Biden will be remembered more favorably,"" he told VOA. ""If Trump really proves to be as dangerous to democratic norms as Biden and the Democrats suggested, then I think he may be seen as very prophetic.""

Conversely, by inheriting a strong economy and a winding down of U.S. foreign entanglements, Trump has the potential to become a president in the caliber of Ronald Reagan, Schwartz said. In which case Biden will be noted by historians for his legislative achievements but ""won’t be remembered as fondly.""

The White House also released an extensive fact sheet detailing the Biden-Harris administration’s achievements domestically and abroad.

The sheet highlighted historic economic progress that added 16.6 million jobs, grew the GDP by 12.6% and raised median household wealth by 37%. It underscored investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors through Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act.

The White House argued that through targeted relief and fair taxation, the Biden administration rebuilt a ""stronger, fairer economy,"" creating opportunity from the bottom up.

Biden ended his farewell address by thanking the nation for the privilege to serve.

""I still believe in the idea for which this nation stands, a nation where the strength of our institutions and the character of our people matter and must endure,"" he said.

""Now it's your turn to stand guard."""
VOA News,Russia's gains in Kursk threaten Kyiv's leverage,2025-03-11T19:51:07-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-gains-in-kursk-threaten-kyiv-s-leverage-/8007377.html,"The images shared by Kremlin-controlled media were shocking: Russian troops hunched, dirt on their faces, as they crept through an empty gas pipeline under Ukrainian defense lines.

Since Kyiv launched its audacious cross-border assault into the Kursk region last August, Moscow has been pushing back hard, using unconventional tactics and deploying thousands of North Korean troops against the Ukrainian army.

They have since stepped up their advances.

In the past five days, Moscow has broken through Kyiv's defensive lines, reclaiming dozens of square kilometers of territory, according to military bloggers.

Russian military bloggers reported Tuesday that Moscow's troops had entered the town of Sudzha, the largest settlement in the region under Kyiv's control.

""The enemy is retreating in panic and disorder without [having] received any orders. That's it. It's a collapse,"" a Russian serviceman, who identified himself as Zombie, told Kremlin-run television.

The result is that Kyiv may have lost one of its only bargaining chips on swapping land with Russia, which has seized and occupied around a fifth of Ukraine since it took Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

For Ukraine, which has painted a more controlled picture of the fighting, the stakes of its difficult operation in Kursk could hardly be higher.

The assault last summer injected a much-needed morale boost into the Ukrainian war effort and represented the first and only incursion by a foreign army into Russian territory since World War II.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the operation was key to future negotiations on ending the war and that holding Russian territory would give Kyiv vital leverage.

But that leverage — just as Washington starts rounds of talks with Moscow and Kyiv — is dwindling as Russian forces press forward.

Franz-Stefan Gady, a military analyst, said Russia had built up its force in Kursk over recent weeks and escalated strikes on Ukraine's supply route.

""The result is that now that the Russians are pushing a lot. Parts of the front line are actually giving way,"" he told AFP.

The British defense ministry estimates Ukraine controls around 300 square kilometers of Kursk, a five-fold territorial loss since Kyiv launched its gambit.

On Monday, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky conceded the situation was worsening.

He dismissed reports Ukrainian troops were in danger of being encircled but acknowledged they had been forced to fall back and that he was sending forward reinforcements.

One Ukrainian soldier who had been deployed in Kursk told AFP on Monday his unit had ""fortunately"" withdrawn five days earlier and described fighting there as ""very"" hard.

Another, who had overseen operations from inside Ukraine and also asked not to be identified to speak freely about the dynamics of the fighting, said Russia's use of drones to disrupt logistics was a key problem.

""It was the end, so to speak. And we started to get out of there because if we didn't, we would have been surrounded,"" he said, recounting the decision of some troops to leave Kursk because of resupply problems and Russian advances.

From the outset, analysts were skeptical of the purpose of diverting thousands of Ukrainian troops and key military assets from front lines inside Ukraine that were under immense Russian pressure.

With Moscow now clawing back land, this question remains.

Russia last week even claimed to have captured a village inside Ukraine, Novenke, which lies just several kilometers from the vital Ukrainian resupply route into Kursk.

The Institute for the Study of War has said that Moscow is consolidating its gains and likely preparing to attack the largest town still under Ukrainian control, Sudzha."
VOA News,Trump says he expects Ukraine will accept mineral deal soon,2025-02-21T15:16:23-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-official-expects-ukraine-to-accept-mineral-deal-/7983752.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he expects Ukraine to accept soon a proposed deal that would include U.S. investments in its mineral assets to help recoup some U.S. defense funding.

""We're signing an agreement, hopefully in the next fairly short period of time, that will assure us that we'll get four or $500 billion back"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about a potential deal.

""It's a big deal, but they [Ukrainians] want it, and it keeps us in that country,"" he said, adding ""we get our money back. This should have been signed long before we went in.""

The Trump administration has proposed the rare earth mineral deal as part of a larger negotiation toward ending the war in Ukraine.

The president's comments follow reports that his administration has presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the initial proposal.

U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz made similar comments earlier Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington.

""Well, look, here's the bottom line: President Zelenskyy is going to sign that deal. And you will see that in the very short term. And that is good for Ukraine,"" he said.

The discussion about a mineral deal follows sharp exchanges this week between Trump and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, responding to Trump's suggestion that Ukraine started the war with Russia, said the U.S. president was living in a Russian-influenced ""disinformation space.""Trump countered on his Truth Social platform, calling Zelenskyy a ""dictator without elections.""On Friday, Trump referenced his indirect exchanges with Zelenskyy while making comments to a gathering of the Republican State Governors Association at the White House. The president described having ""very good talks with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" and ""not such good talks with Ukraine."" He mentioned how Ukraine talks ""tough"" but does not have a lot of bargaining chips.

Diplomatic bomb

On Monday, the international community will hold a meeting in the United Nations General Assembly marking the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, has circulated a draft resolution it plans to put to a vote at the session.

The document stresses ""the urgent need to end the war this year"" through a ""comprehensive, just and lasting peace"" based on the principles of the U.N. Charter and calls for the full withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine ""within its internationally recognized borders.""

However, Ukraine's plans were upended late Friday, when the Trump administration circulated their own draft resolution. Entitled ""The Path to Peace,"" the 65-word text mourns ""the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict"" and ""implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.""

Diplomats said European ambassadors were meeting to discuss the surprise move, which could hurt support for their text or even force them to abandon the effort altogether.

Russia's envoy told reporters the U.S. draft is ""a good move.""

""But there is one important point missing,"" Vassily Nebenzia said. ""The root causes. We should address the root causes.""

His delegation circulated an amendment to Washington's text adding such a statement.

Moscow has long attempted to justify its illegal invasion of Ukraine by saying Russian-speaking minorities in eastern Ukraine have been persecuted by the Kyiv government. The Kremlin also has accused the Ukrainian government of being ""Nazis"" and ""fascists.""

Moscow has also decried what it says is NATO expansionism into its neighborhood.

Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, said on social media platform X that he expects ""the EU and Ukraine to table counter-amendments and make the U.S. text unworkable.""

Ongoing discussions

Trump sent his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired U.S. Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, for meetings Thursday with Zelenskyy in Kyiv, Ukraine. Comments following that meeting indicated the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was being smoothed over.

On his X social media account, Zelenskyy had only positive things to say.

""My meeting with General Kellogg was one that restores hope, and we need strong agreements with the U.S. — agreements that will truly work,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I have instructed my team to work quickly and very sensibly.""

Kellogg, from his X account, re-posted Zelenskyy's comments, and stated, ""Extensive and positive discussions with [President Zelenskyy], the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented national security team.""

Much of the tension this past week surrounded talks about the war in Ukraine between a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. No Ukrainian or European representatives were present.

Rubio later noted that the meeting did not involve any fine points of a deal.

When Trump was asked by reporters Friday if he would be going to Moscow, the president dismissed such reports, saying ""No, no I'm not.""

Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms that could be more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of Ukraine's internationally recognized territory.

European leaders have responded to Trump's recent remarks about Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if the fighting ends.

VOA News,Elon Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant,2025-01-13T16:39:59-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-says-third-patient-got-neuralink-brain-implant/7935447.html,"Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines.

“We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X.

Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.

Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones.

The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.

But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in theNew England Journal of Medicinedescribed how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better.

Who's working on brain-computer interface technology?

More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses.

Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.

Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces.

Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation.

What are the benefits of BCIs?

Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis.

Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know.""

Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink.

“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,"" he said.

How are BCIs tested and regulated?

Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people.

While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.

Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.

Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety.

She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board.

The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,"" said Redberg."
VOA News,Los Angeles fires death toll rises to at least 24,2025-01-12T12:07:44-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/higher-winds-threaten-to-spread-los-angeles-wildfires/7934058.html,"The death toll in the wildfires that are raging in the Los Angeles area rose to at least 24 late Sunday, with officials worried that more bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods that have been leveled by the blazes.

Roaring flames continued to ravage the West Coast state of California as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could pose new threats in the coming days.

“The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,” Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “You never know which way they’re going.”

Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities.

California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the devastated communities “frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.”

“The heartbreak is just overwhelming,” he said.

California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, “in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.”

A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country.

Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:

Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control.

The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, “Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?”

“All of us want to know those answers, and I just don't want to wait because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,” he said. “I want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may. This is not about finger pointing.”

The governor said he is asking the same questions “that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’

Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.

Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes are forecast to return.

“We need to be aggressive out there,” California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz told reporters at a Saturday briefing.

The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112 kph.

Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than 16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures. About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes remain under investigation.

Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11% contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405, into a more heavily populated area.

Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that firefighters have three priorities: “Life, your property and permanent control” of the flames.

Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico.

VOA News,Italian journalist Cecilia Sala freed from Iran’s Evin Prison,2025-01-08T06:55:29-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-says-iran-released-italian-journalist-sala-/7929349.html,"An Italian journalist detained in Iran for three weeks was released Wednesday and is returning home, Italian officials said.

Cecilia Sala was released following “intensive work on diplomatic and intelligence channels,” Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s office said.

The journalist, who contributes to the daily newspaperIl Foglio and hosts the “Stories” podcast for media outlet Chora Media, had been in Iran on assignment and with a journalist visa when she was arrested in the capital, Tehran, on December 19.

The state news outlet IRNA reported that Sala was being held after “violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

The 29-year-old journalist was held in solitary confinement at Iran’s Evin prison. While detained, she told family that she had to sleep on the floor of a cell that had lights on permanently.

Meloni is expected to greet Sala when the journalist arrives in Rome later on Wednesday. “I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped make Cecelia’s return possible, allowing her to re-embrace her family and colleagues” Meloni said in a statement on X.

Sala’s father Renato Sala said he was overcome when he learned that his daughter was returning home.

“I have only cried three times in my life,” he told Reuters. “During this period, I had the impression that a game of chess was being played, but there were more than just two players.”

The National Press Club in Washington welcomed Sala’s release.

“Sala’s ordeal was a brazen attack on press freedom and a reminder of the extraordinary risks journalists face to bring the truth to light,” National Press Club president Emily Wilkins said in a statement. “Her freedom is a victory for journalism and for all who stand against the silencing of the press.”

Iran’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment on Sala’s release.

Sala was detained three days after Swiss-Iranian businessman Mohammad Abedini was arrested in Milan on a U.S. warrant. He is accused of allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2024 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson told the Italian newspaperLa Repubblicathat they believe Sala’s arrest was likely a response to the businessman’s arrest. But Iran has denied that accusation.

Abedini remains detained in Italy, with a court due to decide next week on his request to be released to house arrest ahead of proceedings to extradite him to the U.S.

Iran has long arrested foreigners and dual nationals, including journalists, and then used them as bargaining chips in an attempt to draw concessions from other countries, rights groups say. Iran denies the practice.

American journalist Roxana Saberi was detained by Iran in 2009 and held for around 100 days before being released. And the Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian was held for more than 540 days in Iran before being released in 2016 in a prisoner swap. His wife, journalist Yegi Rezaian, was arrested at the same time and detained for 72 days.

Press freedom groups have said Sala's arrest underscored the poor state of press freedom in Iran. The country is a leading jailer of journalists and it ranks 176 out of 180 countries on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best environment.

VOA News,Money laundering fears hang over Thailand’s online gambling plans,2025-01-19T08:36:50-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/money-laundering-fears-hang-over-thailand-s-online-gambling-plans-/7942266.html,"Thailand’s plans to legalize online gambling are raising fears that criminal gangs will use the industry to move and launder their illicit proceeds as they have done with gambling operators in neighboring countries.

Prasert Jantararuangtong, Thailand’s minister of digital economy and society, said last week that a bill could be ready within a month. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, widely seen as a major force behind the current government, led by his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, avidly endorsed the idea as well last week.

The averred impetus for the push has been both economic and legal.

Thaksin claimed a regulated online gambling industry could net the government nearly $3 billion in annual revenue. By bringing an industry already operating in the shadows into the light, Prasert said the move could also drive out the criminals currently behind many of the betting sites.

""The goal is to regulate underground gambling operations, bringing them into the legal framework and ensuring proper taxation,"" Prasert told reporters.

The push for online gambling is moving ahead as the government is preparing to legalize physical casinos inside integrated resorts featuring hotels, shopping malls and other entertainment. A related bill is due for debate in the National Assembly soon, after winning approval from the prime minister’s Cabinet on Monday.

Gambling in Thailand is currently restricted to betting on state-run horse races and an official lottery.

Many have been warning that expanding the scope of legal gambling in Thailand, especially online, is rife with risk.

Bringing underground gambling operations under government regulation can do some good, Benedikt Hofmann, deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, told VOA.

“But it also opens the door for ostensibly legitimate investments and use of the system by criminal actors for their illicit purposes, especially in a region rife with such actors. As we have seen in the Philippines, creating legal licensing and regulatory frameworks for gambling operators, like the POGO scheme, did not prevent the system from being taken over by highly problematic actors,” he said.

The Philippines launched POGO, the Philippines Offshore Gaming Operator, in 2016 to license online gambling operators, but shut down the program last year. In a state of the nation address in July, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the industry had morphed into a hotbed of cyberscamming, money laundering and human trafficking.

Hofmann said online gambling sites often spring up from physical casinos and can turbocharge their criminal activities.

“Taking advantage of the online space, these operations function around the clock and are theoretically accessible from anywhere in the world, so the reach and volume of both licit and illicit funds processed are much larger. They also offer easier ways to integrate crypto transactions and reduce customer touchpoints, making them highly attractive for money laundering,” he said.

In a 2023 report, the UNODC said Southeast Asia’s transnational crime syndicates had effectively turned the region’s casinos and online betting sites into their own shadow banking network, using them to move and launder tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars a year in earnings from illegal gambling, drug trafficking, cyberscams and other organized crime.

Besides the Philippines, many of those casinos and betting sites operate just across the border from Thailand in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

Amanda Gore, director of the Center for Global Advancement and a forensic accountant who has investigated financial crime around the world, said Thailand’s neighborhood puts the country at high risk of having its own online gambling industry exploited.

“Because they’ve got the same sort of geographical issues … the drug trafficking, the organized crime; it’s all in that area. So, they’re going to have to be extremely strict, and if they’re not then it’s probably going to end up going the same way as the Philippines,” she told VOA.

Gore said the operators behind these online gambling sites often move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in search of the most permissive conditions, and warned that some of those recently shut out of the Philippines could look to Thailand next unless it passes strong laws and backs them up with strict enforcement.

“The key is going to be whether they have a strong enforcement presence behind those regulations and laws as well, because if they don’t, I think it’s going to be very, very vulnerable to the criminal groups in the region, particularly from the money laundering perspective,” she said.

Government officials have said they are aware of the risks and insisted they would only roll out the casinos and online gambling licenses with the necessary guardrails, but they have yet to provide any details.

Spokespersons for the prime minister’s office and the ministries of interior and digital economy and society did not reply to VOA’s requests for elaboration.

Rangsiman Rome, an opposition lawmaker in Thailand’s House of Representatives who chairs the committee on national security, told VOA that he supports the legalization of casinos and a limited online gambling industry in principle but believes the government is not yet up to the task of managing either safely.

“The current law, including law enforcement, is not enough to protect Thai society from the gray capital, the mafia or … money laundering,” he said. “Because now the money laundering already happens, it happens every day, and it looks like the Thai authorities don’t know how to stop this.”

Rangsiman said the government should give itself, lawmakers and the public more time to study and debate the pros and cons before pressing ahead, and that it should focus on rooting out the corruption in the agencies that would be tasked with enforcing any new laws on casinos and gambling first.

Thailand has arrested dozens of police officers for running or protecting underground gambling operations in recent years.

“We see a lot of corruption that happens in Thailand, so we have to fix this before we allow the casinos,” Rangsiman said.

Gore suggested Thailand study well-established gambling commissions such as the United Kingdom’s, which she said could offer useful lessons on how to sanction operators that fail to follow the rules.

The UNODC’s Hofmann said Thailand should also focus on making sure its regulators carefully vet casino investors and players, and consider foregoing online gambling and cryptocurrency payments altogether.

“Even then, risks will remain,” he said, “as we have seen with organized crime infiltrating casino sectors around the world.”"
VOA News,Russia upholds jail term for ex-US Consulate worker,2025-01-17T05:57:35-05:00,https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-upholds-jail-term-for-ex-us-consulate-worker/7940245.html,"A Russian court on Friday upheld the jail term of Robert Shonov, a former U.S. Consulate worker sentenced to almost five years for ""secret collaboration with a foreign state.""

Shonov, a Russian citizen, worked for more than 25 years at the U.S. Consulate in the far eastern city of Vladivostok until 2021, when Moscow imposed restrictions on local staff working for foreign missions.

He was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of passing secret information about Russia's military offensive against Ukraine to the United States in exchange for money and sentenced to four years and 10 months prison in November 2024.

""The judicial act was upheld,"" a court in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk ruled, according to its website, rejecting an appeal Shonov had made against his sentencing.

The United States strongly condemned the conviction last year, calling it an ""egregious injustice"" based on ""meritless allegations.""

In September 2023, Russia expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused of acting as liaison agents for Shonov.

In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and sentenced to long jail terms in Russia.

Others are being held pending trial.

Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against Russia's military offensive, accuses Moscow of arresting Americans on baseless charges to use as bargaining chips in prisoner exchanges.

Even after a landmark prisoner swap in August, several U.S. nationals and dual nationals remain in detention in Russia."
